title: ! '"TLDR" is unnecessary'
published: true

<div>If you summarize your idea in your first sentence, writing "TLDR" is superfluous. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>The English Language already has tools to summarize and communicate your thoughts. &nbsp;Leverage existing conventions, which are accepted by a larger population, and you will engage more users and succeed in communicating your idea.</div>
<p />
<div>"TLDR" stands for "Too Long, didn't read", and began as a response to the "wall of text" style of writing that would appear on sites like Reddit. &nbsp; Over time, it became a shorthand way of saying "Here's a summary.". &nbsp;<p /> However, if you actually wrote the article, it is asinine to preface it with "Too Long; Didn't Read". &nbsp; &nbsp;Of course you read it. &nbsp;You wrote it.<p />Instead, edit your article, and make sure to summarize your point in the first sentence.</div>
