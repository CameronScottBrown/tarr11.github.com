title: Finally getting rid of Octopress

I've moved this blog back to Jekyll from Octopress.   Octopress was a bit too hard to use, and too fragile as well.  

It often broke when I would update the gem and I'd have to dive into the code to figure out what went wrong.

I also disliked how it abused git branches - the source and master branches had nothing to do with each other and that was very confusing.
