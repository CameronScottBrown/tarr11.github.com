title: Fix for Google Voice Android not receiving push notifications
published: true
---
On my Nexus One, Google Voice has push notifications of messages, but the default for this was set to not synchronize.  This meant that I wouldn&#39;t receive Google Voice voicemails for hours, days or weeks.<p /> <div>I just assumed this was an egregious bug.   I have had this phone for over a year, and never noticed these settings.  I&#39;m also surprised that they defaulted to not synchronize.  Not sure if this is still the case for the defaults.</div> <p /><div>If you are not receiving your Google Voice voicemails on your Android phone immediately,  check to see that the settings are correct.<br /><p /><div>Go to Google Voice-&gt;Settings-&gt;Synchronize Inbox and check the box.  Also make sure that Background Data is set to Enabled, and Inbox Notifications are checked.</div> <p /><p /></div>
