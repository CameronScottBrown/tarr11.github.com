I had this idea for a silly game - I wanted to learn about HTML5 Audio.   

I used [Tone.js](http://tonejs.org/) which is a javascript audio
synthesizer library.  

It is based on keyboard input, so won't work on your phone.

I'm also interested in fun game mechanics.  As a developer, there is a
real pleasant joy to tapping the keyboard.  It provides nice tactile
feedback - I often wish I had more to say since I enjoy typing so much (this is part of the reason why I use [vim](http://www.vim.org/).

Additionally, I used [phaser.io](https://phaser.io) which is my favorite
js game engine because of it's ease of use and well designed API.

Generating a pleasing random color is slightly more challenging then just picking from the color space.  Rather than actually figuring it out, I used this [Random Color generator](https://github.com/sterlingwes/RandomColor) from github.

Finally, I grabbed the dancing sprite from the [Fruity Dance Plugin](https://www.image-line.com/support/FLHelp/html/plugins/Fruity%20Dance.htm) and the [Disco Ball](http://geno2925.deviantart.com/art/Super-Mario-World-Disco-Ball-415470107) from user [geno2925](http://geno2925.deviantart.com/) on DeviantArt
