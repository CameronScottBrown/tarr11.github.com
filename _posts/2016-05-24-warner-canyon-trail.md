I recently hiked up to the Warner Canyon Fire Trail in Mill Valley.

To get there, follow up Glen Drive until you hit the fire road.  There
is some street parking right near the entrance.

The trail goes up hill for a bit. 

If you look back, you are rewarded with a view of San Francisco and
the Bay Bridge.

At the top of the trail (maybe 1/2 mile up) you will hit a cross-road,
and you will see a vista of Mount Tamalpais, Corte Madera and as far as
Richmond.
