You shouldn't call yourself a startup advisor unless you have had a successful startup.

If I were to advise startups, most of my advice should be "I don't know".  

A startup advisor is really more of a therapist then a mentor.  

Those who can, do, those who can't, call themselves "startup mentors"

The best startup advice is don't listen to most startup advice.
