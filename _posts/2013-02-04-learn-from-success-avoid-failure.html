title: Learn from success, avoid failure
published: true
---
<p>It has become prevalent to use "failing fast" as jargon for "learning". &nbsp;It is not valuable to fail. Failure means "lack of success". It doesn't mean learning.</p>
<p>When something fails, it is common to identify the failure, and then state that you learned from the failure.</p>
<p>You learn nothing from failure.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have a theory on why you've failed, then make an effort to fix the failure. If you are successful, you will have learned something.</p>
<p>You learned from the success, not the failure. &nbsp;Failure is not sufficient, or even required, for success.</p>
<p>To succeed, prefer to study success. &nbsp;Avoid studying failure, it is a waste of time.</p>
