<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Local First</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">With the advent of HTML5, localStorage, mature javascript client libraries, ubiquitous REST APIs and mobile apps, we don't need to rely as heavily on cloud providers to develop our applications &nbsp;It's time to change how we are writing our apps.</div>

<div><strong>What is local first?</strong></div>
<div>Similar to <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/mobile-first" target="_blank">mobile-first</a> (where you build your app to work well first on mobile, and then expand out to other devices), <strong>Local First</strong> is the idea that you can build a web app that works first as a disconnected app. &nbsp;You can synchronize to cloud providers if you want, but your app should work locally. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>What are the concepts behind local first?</div>
<p />
<blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">
<div><strong>Cloud-optional</strong></div>
<div>- Your app should still work without cloud storage. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Data-permissions</strong></div>
<div>- User data should not be sent to a cloud provider without permission.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Network-optional</strong></div>
<div>- Once installed, apps should run without need for an internet connection.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Cloud-choice</strong></div>
<div>- Users should be able to choose appropriate cloud providers for data storage.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Cloud-provenance</strong></div>
<div>- Cloud providers should clearly document where your data is stored in understandable language</div>

<div><strong>Why Local First?</strong></div>
<div>There are many reasons to build your apps local first. &nbsp;Performance and Stability, User Adoption, and Privacy</div>
<p />

<div><strong>Performance and Stability</strong></div>
<div>Local apps will have less dependency on network calls. &nbsp; &nbsp;This will (usually) make them perform better. &nbsp;If your network goes down, or is slow, firewalled, or otherwise encumbered, your app still works. &nbsp; Less headaches for you as a developer.</div>

<p />
<div><strong>Adoption</strong></div>
<div>Users are increasingly concerned with their privacy. &nbsp;Your application is probably losing users since they are uncomfortable with how you are using their data. &nbsp;Many corporate networks simply will not allow your data to be stored on cloud providers (other than their own networks). &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Government privacy concerns</strong></div>
<div>Government snooping continues to increase. &nbsp;It's a losing battle (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PROTECT_IP_Act" target="_blank">PIPA</a>, <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/254836/mozilla_criticizes_cispa_for_having_broad_alarming_reach.html" target="_blank">CISPA</a>) to fight governments who are intent on monitoring our internet usage and data. &nbsp;As <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304299304577349783428104546.html?mod=googlenews_wsj" target="_blank">more governments gain control of the internet</a> (with different points of view on the importance of free speech and privacy), your data will be in more hands. &nbsp; &nbsp;By all means, let's continue to slow them down. But more importantly, let's make sure our data is not centralized. &nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>What's next?</strong></div>
<div>The idea here is that this is not a centralized approach, so the conversation shouldn't be centralized as well. &nbsp; As a developer, the next thing is to try and build an app this way. &nbsp;Don't start with a SQL database and server application. &nbsp;Start with a client application that works without the cloud. &nbsp;&nbsp;If you've already been doing this, share how you do it. &nbsp;Post your code. &nbsp; &nbsp;Use #localfirst in your tweets, or somewhere in your posts, so we can track local first activity. &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div><strong>What I'm going to do next</strong></div>
<div>I've built my latest app <a href="http://undo.io">undo.io</a> in rails as a web-first app. &nbsp;I'm going to spend a few weeks flipping it to local first. &nbsp;I'll share how that works on my blog&nbsp;</div>
