title: Cisco E2000 Performance Degrades over time on Comcast
published: true
---
I&#39;ve got a Cisco E2000 (from last summer) - the performance seems to degrade over the course of days or weeks. Â <p /><div>If I reboot the router, speed (from <a href="http://speedtest.net">speedtest.net</a>) goes from 3Mbps to 7 or 8Mbps.<p /><div>I&#39;m not sure if this is because of Comcast powerboost, but it seems more likely that it&#39;s some bug in the firmware.</div><p /><div>I&#39;ve just <a href="https://homesupport.cisco.com/en-us/wireless/linksys/E2000">upgraded the firmware</a> to v 1.0.04, maybe that will help.</div> </div>
