<div>Are you a developer or tech type? &nbsp;You probably have a twitter account (here's <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/tarr11">mine</a>). &nbsp;You might even have a <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/douglastarr">LinkedIn account</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>Do you have a <a href="https://github.com/tarr11">github account</a>? &nbsp;</div>

<div>Ever since I've started to work on <a href="http://undo.io">undo.io</a>, I've started attending lots of events and taking a fresh look at the job market. &nbsp;I noticed the trend a few months ago after attending some Seattle&nbsp;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Seattle-Ruby-on-Rails-Developers-Meetup-Group/events/61100872/">Rails</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Node-js/">NodeJS</a> events. &nbsp;As I'm relatively new to the openstack community (coming from windows/.NET) I've been asking for quite a bit of help (people have been really awesome by the way when you ask). &nbsp;The most helpful things I've found are where someone points me to a relevant repo on github. &nbsp;</div>

<div>Github has infected many conversations I have with developers now. &nbsp;Developers don't say "follow me on twitter" or "check out my linkedin account". &nbsp;Instead, they'd point you to their github account, so you could see their latest nodejs project, &nbsp;.vimrc or DCPU-16 hack.</div>
<p />
<div>Code is how developers communicate, and feel most comfortable. &nbsp;Compared to how much we code, we don't really email, tweet, post status updates, or blog posts. &nbsp;README files and comments in code are where we make our jokes, and we define ourselves in terms of languages we know, operating systems, or text editors. &nbsp;(Don't believe me? ask a dev about any one of those topics, see if you can get them to shut up)</div>
<p />
<div>[[posterous-content:7FGDz0WIFFekFHQ8Jwzz]]</div>
<p />
<div>There are an increasing number of forms that have asked for my github account as a supplement to a traditional resume or linkedin profile. &nbsp;It's a really great way to find out who you are as a developer, and what you are interested in. &nbsp;Even if you aren't committing to a major project, looking at what you are watching, in which areas, is incredibly valuable.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>As a hiring manager, it lessens the need for code samples or programming interviews. &nbsp;After all, there's your code, right up there on github. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>Having an active github account doesn't mean you'll <a href="https://github.com/seomoz/ruby-job-application ">get the next job</a>, <a href="http://gun.io/blog/get-freelance-jobs-based-on-your-github-profile/">contract</a>&nbsp;or <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/s2012form">round of funding</a>.</div>
<p />
<div>But if you don't have one? &nbsp;You might get disqualified altogether <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/82973/how-would-you-assess-a-programmers-github-profile">without even knowing it</a>.</div>
