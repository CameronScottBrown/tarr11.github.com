title: The suffix strategy for password generation is not secure
published: true
---
One of the most common password strategies is to take some random, relatively secure, long base password, and then re-use it over and over by appending an easily recallable suffix to that string (usually related to the name of the domain of the password)<p /><div>Ie.., let&#39;s say you chose <b>jkfd$k#d251mf</b> as your base password.  You dutifully memorize this password.  Then when you go to various websites, you append an easily recognizable suffix to that password:</div> <p /><div><b>jkfd$k#d251mf</b>facebook</div><div><div><b>jkfd$k#d251mf</b>google</div></div><div><div><div><b>jkfd$k#d251mf</b>twitter</div></div></div><p /><div>The problem with this is that let&#39;s say you visit <a href="http://badguy.com">badguy.com</a> who is a criminal looking to harvest passwords.</div> <p /><div>So you enter your password:</div><div><b>jkfd$k#d251mf</b>badguy</div><p /><div>Now, <a href="http://badguy.com">badguy.com</a> knows this is pretty common, so he can just run a regex like so: (.*)badguy and find out your base password.  At that point, he&#39;s got access to any well-known website where you&#39;ve used that base password.</div> <p /><div>So, next, you say, well, I have two base passwords, one for websites I really trust (say, google, your bank, etc) and another for random sites I&#39;ve never heard of and don&#39;t care if they get cracked.</div> <p /><div>The problem now is that on the supposedly secure sites, you are relying on any one of them to secure all of them.  So a bad guy just picks the least secure of your most secure sites, and then he&#39;s got access to all of your really secure information.</div> <p /><div>The idea of simplifying your life with fewer passwords is a fallacy - once you have to recall more than four different passwords, you might as well have a strategy that allows you to call hundreds. <p /></div>
