  <p>@Aaron Parecki, that makes sense.   I've removed pingback and will try to understand how to use this more.</p>
  <p>I think that there are some solutions to these problems around spam and it's probably more addressable in a distributed system than it is in a centralized one</p>
  <p>I really like what you are doing with this!.</p>
  <p>My blog is on github pages so I'm going to play around with making this all play nicely there.</p>
