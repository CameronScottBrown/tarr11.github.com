title: Viewing OneNote 2010 notes by last edit date
published: true

It is surprisingly hard to figure out how to view your OneNote 2010 notes by date.  A common scenario is that I want to view the notes I took yesterday.   In both Google Docs and Evernote, this is the default view (all notes sorted descending by date).<p /><div>In OneNote 2010, here&#39;s how you do it:</div><p /><div>Share Menu-&gt;Recent Edits-&gt;Since Yesterday </div><p /><div>This will find all notes, sorted by date, since yesterday.</div> <p /><div>Seems like this should be in the &quot;View&quot; or &quot;Review&quot; menu, as opposed to the &quot;Share&quot; menu.</div>
