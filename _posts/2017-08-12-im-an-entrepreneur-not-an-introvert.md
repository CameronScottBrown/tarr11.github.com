So, this has now happened to me several times, and I feel the need to write about it, to explain myself.  

Every few years, I get an itch to start a business.  Relatively quickly, I cease most non-required social interactions.   If things work out, I start socializing again, and focusing on the external world.   You can tell if I'm in the thick of it if my hair is kind of standing up and i have a few days of stubble. 

There's a lot of stress involved in starting a company, and most of it is unseen.  I know a lot of entrepreneurs, and most of the time, the unwritten code is simply to keep it to yourself.

Eventually, it changes and life goes back to normal. But this can often take several years.  During those several years, it feels like 

Like most people, most of my friends are not entrepreneurs.  They have careers that they've worked hard at.  Their career is one of their core assets.  

I am a bit jealous of them!  When things are not going well at work, it's fairly easy to leave it there.  

For me, it's never been that way. I've never really cared about my career, and would switch from one vertical to another without a second thought.  I was more focused on my idea.
