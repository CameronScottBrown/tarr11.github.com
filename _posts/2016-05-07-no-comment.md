I've removed comments completely at this point from my blog.

My reasoning is that I don't wish to deal with spam, and there are
certainly enough places to post your feedback.

I tried [webmention](https://indiewebcamp.com/Webmention) but it seems
to suffer from spam just like most other solutions.

If you want to contact me about my posts, or have any questions, you can do that on Twitter [@tarr11](https://twitter.com/tarr11) or [contact](/contact.html) me through some other channel.
