Recently, I was setting up a new Facebook page with a naming convention that capitalizes various words.<p /><div>[[posterous-content:YMhRfIb8DP3YSrcFuRmn]]<br /></div><p /><div>For whatever reason ,Facebook has decreed that this is not the appropriate naming convention.</div><p /><div>This is easily worked around.  </div><p /><div>To fix,  accept their selection.  </div> <p /><div>Then go to your page, click &quot;Edit Page-&gt;Update Info&quot;</div><p /><div>Under name, select the name with casing you wish to have.  In the &quot;Edit&quot; window, it will allow you to select whatever casing you want.</div>
