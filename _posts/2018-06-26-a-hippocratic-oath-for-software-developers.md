![alt text](/images/hippocrates2.jpg "Hippocrates")

I swear by Apollo the Logical, by Athena the Wise, by Harmonia, by Eris, and by all the gods and goddesses, making them my witnesses, that I will carry out, according to my ability and judgment, this oath and this indenture.

To hold my PM in this art equal to my own developers; to make my Ops Team partner in my livelihood; when they are in need of status updates, I will share mine with them; to consider their interns as my own, and to teach them this art, if they want to learn it, without fee or promise of stock options; to impart hacker news links, slack emoji, and all other instruction to my own direct reports, the direct reports of my manager, and to bootcamp graduates who have taken the developer’s oath, but to nobody else.

I will write code to create software according to my ability and judgment, but never with a view to useless abstractions. Neither will I under-estimate the length of a task to anybody when asked to do so, but instead triple its length.  Nor will I rewrite working code in a new language to satisfy my curiosity.  Similarly I will not give to sales a feature which they have promised outside of our schedule . But I will keep pure and holy both my life and my art and avoid writing 3 lines of code when only 1 is necessary, and I will endeavour to understand all code that I may copypaste from Stack Overflow. I will not test in production, not even, verily, for a very small fix, but I will endeavour to create a continuous delivery system.

Into whatsoever codebase I enter, I will enter to help the customer, and I will abstain from sniping, especially towards our paying users. And whatsoever I shall see or hear of my customer’s data, as well as outside my profession in my intercourse with people, if it be what should not be published abroad, I will never divulge, even on anonymous message boards, holding such things to be holy secrets.

Now if I carry out this oath, and break it not, may I gain forever reputation, StackOverflow points and Github Stars among all people for my life and for my art; but if I break it and forswear myself, may I be doomed to be hounded by recruiters on LinkedIn, forever and ever.
