title: A drip email gem for rails

I've created [Dripper](https://github.com/tarr11/dripper) which is a
drip email gem designed for rails using a DSL.


I needed a DRIP email service, and as both developer and marketer, I wanted to build something that works easily with rails. Most DRIP SAAS products are too expensive for websites where visitors don't pay. I love sites like intercom, but they don't make sense unless are generating revenue.
