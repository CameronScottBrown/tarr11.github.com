<p>I recently got a Google Chromecast, and was looking for a way to push custom images as a screensaver for it.</p>

<p>Though there's no obvious "set it and forget it" that runs headless, you can easily run the built-in
<a href="https://clients3.google.com/cast/chromecast/home">Chromecast wallpapers</a> in FullScreen mode.</p>

<p>Just click to that page, use the Chromecast extension, and type F11 to put it in full screen mode. </p>
