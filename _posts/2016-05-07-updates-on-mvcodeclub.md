It's been a while since I've updated this blog on the latest news at [MV
Code Club](https://www.mvcodeclub.com)

Back in 2013, I resolved to teach my [4th grade son and 11 of his
friends to code](/Teaching-Coding-to-4th-graders)  

That project was successful, and turned out to be much larger than I had expected.   There was a lot of interest in our program from the local community in Mill Valley, and so I expanded it.

We rented a space in Mill Valley, and kids started to come in after
school to join.  Within a few months, the program was bigger than I
could handle on my own, so I started hiring some people.

This wouldn't have happened without a lot of local community
support from friends, family and schools.

Since 2013, [MV Code Club](https://www.mvcodeclub.com) has expanded and we run 3 clubs in Mill
Valley, Central Marin (Greenbrae) and San Francisco, CA.  We also teach
coding 
in a number of schools in San Francisco and Marin. We also run camps
during the summer and school year.

Originally, when I had started, I had thought I would [put the coding
lessons I used onto Github](/an-open-source-coding-curriculum)  I moved
away from this, because github was great for hosting static
content, but not as good for teaching kids to code.  Being a
developer, my solution was to build software to solve this problem.

So, I started working on the [mvcodeclub
website](https://www.mvcodeclub.com) which would help run the
program and be a place where we could host our lessons.  The idea was
still to keep those lessons open source, but instead of being on
github, they would be stored on our website.

The website started to be focused on the clubs and programs we run
with our staff, and we decided we needed to separate out the
content so that it could be used by others.  Our coding platform is also
used by other programs, such as the iCanCode club in Rochester, NY.

So, we launched
[MVCode](https://www.mvcode.co) a few months ago and all of our
[coding courses](https://www.mvcode.co) and [coding lessons](https://www.mvcode.co/lessons) are hosted there.  It is designed for kids, so you don't have to log in or create an account to view or try the lessons.    We have lessons for Scratch, Javascript, Minecraft, Arduino, HTML and a variety of other platforms.

Our goal with the MVCode platform is to create a frictionless, and web-based environment that
enables anyone to teach coding to kids.   We believe that if we can
make it easy to learn and teach coding, more people will do it and
create lots of interesting lessons and projects.

If you are a teacher or are interested in learning to code, please
[check out MVCode](https://www.mvcode.co) and let me know what you
think.
