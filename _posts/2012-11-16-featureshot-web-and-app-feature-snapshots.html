title: FeatureShot - Web and App Feature Snapshots
published: true
---
<p>I've been working on a new website called&nbsp;<a href="http://www.featureshot.com">FeatureShot</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I've been building apps this past year, I've been overwhelmed at how fast website and apps are innovating. &nbsp;It is really hard to keep up, let alone discover new things or incorporate new trends into products I'm building.</p>
<p>So, I built a tool that is aimed at developers and product managers who spend a lot of time evaluating new features of websites. &nbsp;It allows you to take screenshots and categorize web and app features.</p>
<p>
<p>It is also a useful tool for anyone who is interested in seeing an "inside look" of new apps and website features.</p>
<p>If a product is big and complex enough, it is overwhelming to try and review it. &nbsp;Instead, you want to review a small, digestible part of that feature. &nbsp;I call those reviews "<strong>FeatureShots"</strong>&nbsp;- they are simply a few screen grabs of a feature, with a bit of explanation around what it does.</p>
</p>
<p>My vision is to build a comprehensive feature graph that connects these features. &nbsp;That way, you view all the features that make up a product, compare it to other features in other products, and discover new features that you might like. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please <a href="http://www.featureshot.com">check it out</a>, and let me know what you think.</p>
