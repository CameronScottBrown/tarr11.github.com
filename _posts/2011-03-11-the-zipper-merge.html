<p>There used to be a spot on SR900 in Issaquah where we had a merge like this.Â  Someone nearly ran me off the road for doing a zipper merge.</p> <p>Glad to find out it actually has a name.</p> <p>Also glad they expanded the road to 2 lanes...</p> <p>Follow the discussion here <br /> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/g1rli/you_are_not_clever/">http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/g1rli/you_are_not_clever/</a></p>
