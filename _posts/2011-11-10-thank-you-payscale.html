<p><span>I have no idea how I made it through today. &nbsp;It was one of the hardest days of my professional career.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I announced that I will be transitioning out of my position as VP of Consumer Products and Chief Architect at PayScale. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<div>Back in 2000, Joe Giordano gave me the opportunity to help him build create an innovative product that changed how people and businesses have thought about pay. Back then, I was not married, lived in San Francisco, and most of my hair was brown.</div>
<p />
<div>Eleven years later, I am married, have two beautiful children, live in Issaquah, Washington, and have a head of full of grey hair. &nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the opportunity to work with amazing people at PayScale, and I have learned so much. &nbsp;&nbsp;We&rsquo;ve built a great thing and changed how people get paid.</div>
<p />
<div>To all of you involved with PayScale, past, present, future - thank you. The list is long and I&rsquo;m going to screw it up if I try to name you all in here. &nbsp;But you know who you are and I owe each of you a beer.</div>
<div><br />All I can say about what&rsquo;s next is that I am going to be launching something new, soon. Those of you who know me shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised at the direction I&rsquo;m heading in. &nbsp;You may hear more from me publicly than you are used to. Thanks for your support and stay tuned. &nbsp;</div>
