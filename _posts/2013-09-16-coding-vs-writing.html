<p>As someone who sits in front of a computer all day, I should be writing more on my blog.</p>

<p>When I am coding, I am in a comfortable environment (Visual Studio) and workstation is completely setup for writing</p>

<p>I have always struggled with a good environment for writing.  Currently, I switch between vim and Sublime Text, but I don't really find either of those to be effective, since they are lacking tools to help me lookup things and integrate them into my workflow.</p>

<p>It's pretty clear that if I am going to write more, it needs to be as easy as coding.</p>

<p>What do you do to make writing easier?</p>

<p>Update! I just discovered <a href ="http://prose.io">Prose.io</a> which is a nice little content editor for github pages.  Perfect!</p>
