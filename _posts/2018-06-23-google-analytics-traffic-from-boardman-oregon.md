I've been noticing a trend on several sites using Google Analytics.  There seems to be a lot of traffic coming from Boardman, Oregon.

Turns out that Amazon Web Services runs a [pretty big datacenter there](http://www.eastoregonian.com/eo/local-news/20170317/amazon-keeps-building-data-centers-in-umatilla-morrow-counties)

> Online retail giant Amazon, which operates two server farms near Boardman and one near Umatilla, 

Lots of other people are seeing traffic from Boardman as well:

> OMG Boardman!!! Ashburn!!! I’ve had almost 30000 visits from Boardman in the last 6 weeks. Boardman is a tiny town in Oregon, population 3220 people …. and they’re all coming to my site almost 8x each for less that a second!!!! HEEEEELLLLPPPPP!!!! I’m being overrun by Boardman men! Who are these people!!
