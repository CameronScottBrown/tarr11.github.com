<div class="entry-content"><p><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.499999046325684px;">Last friday, I posted my private beta test of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.corpqna.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.499999046325684px;">CorpQNA</a><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.499999046325684px;">&nbsp;on&nbsp;</span><a href="http://seattletechstartups.com/mailman/listinfo/organize" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.499999046325684px;">Seattle Tech Startups</a><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.499999046325684px;">&nbsp;list. &nbsp;I've been on this list for many years, and even though I no longer live in Seattle, I feel like it is one of the most supportive and valuable startup resources I've experienced.</span>

<p />

<p />

<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.499999046325684px;">A couple of people were interested to know in how this offer was received by the community. &nbsp;I'm just quickly sharing a few stats in case you are thinking of sending an "early beta" product announcement of your own via STS. &nbsp;Hopefully you can learn something.</div>

<p />

<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.499999046325684px;">I feel like real numbers are valuable. &nbsp;Because I am bootstrapping this on my own, I don't have to ask anyone if I can share these numbers. :)</div>

<p />

<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.499999046325684px;">

<div><strong>50-100</strong>&nbsp;clicked to&nbsp;CorpQNA's home page. &nbsp;(I don't have exact metrics here, since I didn't put a tracking code on the link)</div>

<div><strong>10</strong>&nbsp;people clicked on the "offer link"</div>

<div><strong>6</strong>&nbsp;signed up for the beta</div>

<div><strong>5</strong>&nbsp;people emailed offline with feedback</div>

<div><strong>0&nbsp;</strong>people accused me of spamming the list. &nbsp; &nbsp; :)</div>

<p />

<div>I feel pretty good about these numbers. &nbsp;Most of those people have engaged with the product at least once or twice over the past week.</div>

<div>

<p />

<div>Overall, I've got about 15-20 companies signed up at this point. &nbsp; Half of those were just people who signed up and haven't come back. &nbsp; &nbsp; The other half are marginally interested. &nbsp; A couple are decently engaged.</div>

<p />

<div>Some other learnings I've had:</div>

<p />

<div><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Spending face to face time with potential users is more valuable than online channels. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong></div>

<div>If you can pitch someone directly, they will just go to your site and signup. &nbsp;You won't have to worry about a great landing page yet. &nbsp;This especially important when you are still validating your MVP and don't want to spend a lot of time building marketing collateral that may not matter.</div>

<div><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Enterpreneurs are generally more supportive</span></strong></div>

<div>They are willing to try new products, compared to "normal people". &nbsp;I think part of that is because they know how hard it is to get started, part of that is they are very curious about what's new in the market. &nbsp;Though they don't necessarily represent your target market segment, they are really valuable early adopters.</div>

<p />

<div><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Adwords can be a challenging channel to get beta users</span></strong>.&nbsp;</div>

<div>It costs $15/click in adwords to bid on "collaboration software". &nbsp;</div>

<p />

<div>They have a lot of very immediate "bounce quality" metrics and will turn off your keywords if they are not creating a good user experience. &nbsp;I haven't focused too much on that landing page experience and it doesn't perform well on its own yet. &nbsp; If you aren't polished enough, your ad won't perform. &nbsp;And if you spend time polishing your ad too much, you aren't working on your product. &nbsp;If you are entering an established space., you also either have to pick keywords that are highly qualified (which are expensive), cheap (which are not going to convert) , or undiscovered (which means low volume) &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<p />

<div>The adwords interface can also be a bit overwhelming for a new user. &nbsp;It's a "dashboard" designed for SEM professionals who spend all day managing keyword spend.<p /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Facebook is a little bit easier</span></strong><br />Facebook has a "technology early adopter" segment in their ad tool. &nbsp;This is a nice shortcut and feels like it's designed for beta tests. &nbsp;But,&nbsp;If you are going to use Facebook to show ads, don't put an ugly logo up there. &nbsp;Put a picture of a person instead. &nbsp;Make sure you have a call to action. &nbsp;Your CPM rates change dramatically based on clickthrough and this stuff helps.</div>

</div>
