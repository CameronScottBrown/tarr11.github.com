<div class="entry-content"><p>The past 3 weeks, the kids have been learning a lot of things.  How to interact with Scratch, basic programming concepts, and some basic computer skills.</p>

<p>This week, we spent a little time learning something new (events and message passing) but most of the time, I wanted the kids to be focused on building something.</p>

<h2>Unity Video</h2>

<p>We watched this short time lapse video of someone building a game scene in Unity 3D. This looks more like the games that they play on consoles at home.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Z2ZX9soqOz4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<h2>Message Passing</h2>

<p>Our goal this week was for the kids to learn about how to animate a story.  The tools in Scratch for doing this are pretty light &ndash; they don&rsquo;t really support a timeline UI for keyframing, so there&rsquo;s a lot of manual counting going on in order to synchronize your characters.</p>

<p>I wanted to teach them about message passing, which is a powerful concept that lets them control their animations via events, as opposed to trying to coordinate timing.</p>

<h2>Animation Challenge</h2>

<p>I presented the kids with a challenge &ndash; they had to animate a story, but they were only allowed to press one button to start it, and then it needed to run on its own (sort of like tipping over dominoes)
<img src="/images/dominoes.jpg" alt="Dominoes" /></p>

<p>They had gotten comfortable with event based processing, where they were controlling the animation sort of like a puppet show.  ie., press &ldquo;j&rdquo; and a character will jump.  I wanted them to use messages to instead say &ldquo;when this sprite is finished, it broadcasts a message&rdquo;.  And then, another sprite would listen for that</p>

<p>They spent much of the class working in teams of two, coming up with a story and then trying to animate it.  I liked this model because they would learn based on what they needed, as opposed to just going through and learning every command in the platform.</p>

<p>They loved to record sounds and have their characters do things together.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of one of the animations (based on Pokemon) the kids put together:</p>

<p>Pretty impressive for some 4th graders who did this in about an hour!</p>

<h2>Computers, Creativity, Collaboration and Communication</h2>

<p>I spent some time thinking about the the role of a computer in the creative process.  There is a danger that because computers are powerful devices, they can have a hypnotic effect on the kids.</p>

<p>I wanted the kids to think about what they wanted to build, instead of just clicking around the computer.  This is an important skill for them to learn &ndash; these are just tools and they need to use the tools, not have the tools use them.</p>

<p>So, they spent a few minutes discussing what they wanted to build.  This was somewhat challenging and overwhelming.  A lot of them just wanted to mess around and build it that way.  I think that&rsquo;s fine, but I also wanted them to have their own point of view.</p>

<p>Some of the kids have more experience than others, and I wanted them to learn how to work together and teach each other.  If they are just working alone, they might as well be at home!  So, I spend some time each class trying to get them to work together, communicate, and solve problems together.  Since I&rsquo;ve put them on time limits for this project, that can be somewhat stressful.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a good skill for them to learn how to manage their time and their communication under time pressure.</p>

<h2>Advanced Class + Another Intro Class In January</h2>

<p>We are going to have an advanced class starting in January.  I think it still will be focused around Scratch &ndash; there is a lot to learn here and I&rsquo;d like them to get a bit more mastery before we move on to more complex topics.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also thinking about running another Intro class &ndash; this is for 4th graders, but it could also work for 3rd and 5th graders as well.  I&rsquo;m hoping to include more girls as well, to balance things out.</p>

<h2>Mill Valley Code Club Website, Facebook, and HQ</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve finally got a the <a href="http://www.mvcodeclub.com">Mill Valley Code Club Website</a> setup.  This is where the kids log in, keep notes, and learn about new lessons.  I&rsquo;ll probably improve it more over time.</p>

<p>Also, I&rsquo;ve setup a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/mvcodeclub">Facebook Page</a> and a <a href="http://twitter.com/mvcodeclub">Twitter</a> if you are interested in following along.</p>

<h2>Code Club HQ?</h2>

<p>I am looking at renting out a small space in downtown Mill Valley, to run Code Club classes.  We&rsquo;ve been running out of my house which has been fine, but things get a little hectic, and there&rsquo;s a lot of setup and teardown that I have to do in our living room.</p>

<p>If we have a space, I can add some better hardware.  I have my eye on a <a href="http://www.makerbot.com">Makerbot</a> for example, which would be a fun thing for the kids to play with.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll probably also get a server that we can run Minecraft on, and a bunch of other fun stuff like <a href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a>, <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a> etc.</p>

<h2>Github</h2>

<p>As always, <a href="https://github.com/tarr11/coding-lessons/blob/master/4th-grade-coders/lesson-4.md">this weeks lesson plan</a> is on Github.  Enjoy!</p>
