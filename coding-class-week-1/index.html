<div class="entry-content"><p>This was the first week of my <a href="/categories/mvcoders">8 Week Coding Class for 4th Graders</a></p>

<p>I ran 2 classes after school (about 5 kids per class) after school.  I was a bit nervous to get started as I had no idea what was going to happen, or if the kids were going to get bored.  We followed the plan that I laid out in my <a href="https://github.com/tarr11/coding-lessons/blob/master/4th-grade-coders/lesson-1.md">the fourth grade coding curriculum</a> on Github, with a few modifications.</p>

<h2>After school</h2>

<p>Getting everyone to focus at the beginning was tough.  They came directly from school and were a little bit rambunctious from sitting in class all day.  Some kids immediately booted up their laptops to play a video game and I had to tell them not to.</p>

<h2>Computers</h2>

<p>I asked the kids to bring their own laptops if possible.  I have a series of old laptops and fortunately, most of them worked, even if they were a little bit slow.   I needed Google Chrome installed on each computer, which I had to install on a few of their laptops.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to avoid using any native shell programs since they aren&rsquo;t going to be the same amongst all the laptops that the kids have.  For example, I&rsquo;ve had kids bring Macbooks, Chromebooks and Windows 7 and 8 laptops.  Even trying to get a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">bash shell</a> running on all those environments would have been tough.</p>

<p>In the future, I may look at <a href="http://nitrous.io">Nitrous.io</a> if I do want a terminal that they can all use.  I tried out making a &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; <a href="http://voxeljs.com">Voxel.js</a> / <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> with Nitrous, and that worked.  I may use that in a future class, to show them how you can code your own Minecraft world.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I asked the kids what they thought programming was.  Some named programming languages like HTML.  One mentioned &ldquo;The Matrix&rdquo; and how they used progrmaming there. A few said Minecraft.  Some said it was a way to get computers to do what you want.  A few had no idea.</p>

<p>I asked them what they wanted to do in the class?  In the first class, they all unanimously said &ldquo;make video games&rdquo;.  Some had very specific ideas about the games that they wanted to make.  In the second class, it was a mix.  One wanted to make a very specific Minecraft plugin that made it easy and safe to make other Minecraft plugins.  One wanted to make it safer to use computers online (he was on a Windows 8 laptop, FWIW).  The rest wanted to make video games.</p>

<p>They responded well (&ldquo;woohoo!&rdquo;) when I told them that this wasn&rsquo;t going to be like a normal class in school where you had to listen to a teacher talk, and that they&rsquo;d spend a lot of time coding.  That said, I did have to calm them down periodically, just like any class.</p>

<h2>ChromeCast</h2>

<<<<<<< HEAD
<p>The class was in our living room, and I used my laptop + <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/chromecast/">ChromeCast</a> to show them videos and code samples on the screen.  This worked out really well - we watched the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc">Code.org video</a> in one of the classes, and the kids responded really well to seeing Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg on the screen, talking about coding.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>, I heard about a cool site called <a href="http://codecombat.com">CodeCombat</a> which teaches kids some javascript and coding fundamentals.  There are a series of &ldquo;challenges&rdquo; that the kids have to go through, such as having their knight defeat a troll, move around a maze, and say various things in order.   Overall - the kids LOVED this game and had a lot of fun.  I think they didn&rsquo;t even realize that they were learning coding.  I heard from one parent that their kid had a lot of fun but didn&rsquo;t learn much. I think this was because they thought they were just playing a game.  But in order to play the game, you have to write a lot of javascript, understand logic flow and how to construct and debug a sophisticated program.  So, I considered it a success because it was a lot of fun.</p>

<p>That said, running the class reminded me of the game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diner_Dash">Diner Dash</a> for a while. In that game, you are a waitress, and your job is to take and serve complex orders in a diner very quickly.  If you mess up the orders or take too long, customers get mad.  If you do everything right, you get points. I found that with 5 or 6 kids, especially as they get going, they are hitting roadblocks about every minute.   Most of these involved some sort of debugging of their javascript code.  They would say &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not working&rdquo; and I&rsquo;d come over and try to help them figure out what&rsquo;s wrong.   If I spent too much time helping one student, the bugs would back up and I&rsquo;d have a lot of kids unhappy.  If the kids were blocked for too long, they would get frustrated.</p>

<p>One thing I am not sure about is how someone with no programming experience can help kids.  Most of the problems that I was solving for were debugging issues.  These are easy for developers to solve (sometimes) but sometimes they are not!  Some of these problems could be resolved with a more sophisticated user interface.  But making debugging &ldquo;easy&rdquo; is a famously hard problem in computer science.  One example of this problem is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">halting problem</a>  Ie, trying to detect if a computer is stuck in an infinite loop.   I think this gets easier with visual programming languages since it&rsquo;s easier to stay &ldquo;on the rails&rdquo;.  But, much of the power of coding is still in language based coding, so I want to balance out these two techniques.</p>

<p>That said, whenever the kids solved a problem on their own (ie, fixed a missing parentheses, semicolon, or capitalization), they would get very excited that they accomplished something.  CodeCombat also did a good job of helping them celebrate their victories by showing them a little animation of their knight crushing the enemy or winning.</p>

<h2>Browser Based Coding</h2>

<<<<<<< HEAD
<p>CodeCombat uses two windows - a game and a javascript editor in a browser.  This does present some challenges.  The coding window loses focus a lot, and the kids expect when they start typing, sometimes nothing would happen.  The game would occasionally get stuck, or the browser would get wonky, and I&rsquo;d have to reset the screen.   At this age (9 + 10 years old), this would be a tough game for the kids to learn without my help.</p>

<p>The kids also needed to learn to type like a software developer would.  Learning how to type as a coder is different than typing words.  I am not teaching them to use advanced coding motions (ie, <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a> ) but there are a set of things that they need to code javascript.  For example, they need to know various characters - parentheses, semicolon, single and double quotes.  They need to know how to position the cursor on a line and insert a new line below it.  They need to know how to &ldquo;pronounce&rdquo; code.  ie, when I asked them to pronounce &ldquo;this.moveNext();&rdquo;, they said &ldquo;this period move next parentheses parentheses semicolon&rdquo;.   Teaching them how &ldquo;talk in code&rdquo; was a surprising thing that was important to teach.</p>

<h2>CodeClub Software</h2>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-YV1ZHLB3uao/UnGDazlwlCI/AAAAAAAAYlE/K5tPI5iS5JM/w1623-h1217-no/20131030_150608.jpg" alt="CodeClub Software on ChromeCast" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve built a little ASP.NET MVC website that gives them logins, lets them take notes, and then guides them through the class using the curriculum that I put on Github.   This mostly worked, but there was a bug in the first class where some of their notes didn&rsquo;t save.   This software is really valuable for parents to see what&rsquo;s going on, and it gives me a way to communicate and guide the class.  This code isn&rsquo;t available yet but I plan to put it online in a few weeks.</p>

<h2>Second Class</h2>

<p>The goal of the next class is to introduce them to <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">MIT Scratch</a> which is a visual environment for learning to make games and animations.  I&rsquo;m working on the curriculum now, so check back in a week or so to see how that went.</p>
