<a href="/"></a>If you have a 64 bit version of Microsoft Office, you will not be able to use LinkedIn&#39;s social connector.  It claims to install, but then you do not see any new social connectors installed.  <p /><div>So, if you see that your social connector list is blank, or you can&#39;t find your LinkedIn social connector, or if your linkedIn social connector is not working, it may be because you are on 64 bit windows.</div> <p /><div>According to <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/outlook/thread/d0b1209d-4bcd-4a91-b1f2-bf0d3545f4d6/">this link</a>, LinkedIn is currently working on a 64-bit social connector. </div> <p /><div>In the meantime, you can try <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/outlook/thread/d0b1209d-4bcd-4a91-b1f2-bf0d3545f4d6/">Facebook&#39;s 64 bit social connector</a>.</div>
