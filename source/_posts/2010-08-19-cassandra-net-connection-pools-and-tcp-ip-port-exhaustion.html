title: Cassandra, .NET, Connection Pools and TCP/IP Port Exhaustion
published: true

<div>The Cassandra Thrift client does not contain any connection pools. &nbsp;Since it connects via TCP/IP, you will inevitably run out of sockets if you call the Cassandra often.</div>
<p />
<div>The error you will see (at least in .NET) is:</div>
<p />
<div>"Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted".</div>
<p />
<div>Here's some code that will cause this error:</div>
<div><script src="https://gist.github.com/538029.js"></script></div>
<p />
<div>If you run netstat -n after you run this code, you'll see this:</div>
<div><script src="https://gist.github.com/538032.js"></script></div>
<p />
<div>TCP/IP ports do not close right away. &nbsp;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa560610(BTS.20).aspx">Instead, they go into a TIME_WAIT state</a>&nbsp;for 240 seconds. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>So, in order to use Cassandra in any high volume application, you'll have to implement your own connection pool.</div>
<p />
<div>The three .NET cassandra clients seem to implement connection pooling.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://aquiles.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=217616">This comment </a>seems to imply that the connection pooling code in Hector Sharp is problematic. &nbsp;After briefly looking at it, it made me nervous. &nbsp;Anyone have any experience with it?</div>

<div>Alternatively, you can implement your own connection pooling mechanism.</div>
