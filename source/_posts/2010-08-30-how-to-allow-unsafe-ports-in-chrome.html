title: How to allow unsafe ports in Chrome
published: true
---
<div>In Chrome, if you attempt to access a website on some non-standard ports, such as port 87, you will see:</div><p /><div>&quot;This webpage is unavailable&quot; and the text of your error will be:</div><p /><div><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;">Error 312 (net::ERR_UNSAFE_PORT): Unknown error.</span></div><p /><div>To fix this, you have to explicitly allow the unsafe port when you start up chrome.  </div><p /><div>Right click on your chrome icon that you use to launch chrome, and click properties.</div><p /><div>The textbox that says &quot;Target&quot; will look something like this (your username obviously)</div>C:\Users\dougt\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe<p /><div>To allow ports 81,84 and 87, change it to:</div> C:\Users\dougt\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe --explicitly-allowed-ports=81,84,87<div><p /><div><div>This is different from FireFox, <a href="http://www.haqthegibson.com/article/12">which does this in about:config</a> </div> </div></div><p /><div>There are many sites (<a href="http://www.ericdlarson.com/misc/chrome_command_line_flags.html">such as this</a>) that describe all the chrome command line switches, but oddly, most of them do not include explicitly-allowed-ports</div>
