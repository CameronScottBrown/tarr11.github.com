<p>Each time you have a new idea, put your notes in a repo for it, instead of simply storing it Dropbox or on your local computer.</p>

<p>If it's an open source project, push that repo to Github.  Then you can advertise it on a public repository like Github, and actually start working on it and without having it complete.</p>

<p>This will get you started quicker, and when you have some time or you want to go back to that project, it will be all ready for you.</p>
