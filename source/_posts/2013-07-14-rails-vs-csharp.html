<p>In which I write a few thoughts on Rails v CSharp</p>
<p>I originally published this on Seattle Tech Startups mailing list</p>
<ul>
<li>The market in Seattle is distorted with a lot more startup oriented .NET devs than you will see in just about any other city.</li>
<li>When I tell people that I work on .NET startups in SF, and they are Rails devs, they look at me like I'm crazy and building my app in COBOL.NET.  They still think ASP.NET == WebForms.</li>
<li>BizSpark is offering effectively 3 years of free hosting to startups.  This is changing the market and getting more new companies to try out .NET</li>
<li>The dynamic features of the CLR / .NET still are not as useful as the dynamic features of Rails.</li>
<li>ASP.NET MVC / WebAPI is on par with Rails</li>
<li>Entity Framework Code First is not as good as Active Record.</li>
<li>People's faith in Rails security has been shaken this year by a series of apocolyptic security flaws.</li>
<li>.NET security is very good.</li>
<li>The user model in rails is more extensible and well thought out than the off-the-shelf ASP.NET model.</li>
<li>The rubygems ecoysystem is better than the nuget ecosystem, (and probably always will be)</li>
<li>is mitigated by a lot of javascript based services that function the same way as a gem might.</li>
<li>Azure no longer sucks.</li>
<li>If you believe in OSS as a core part of your being, you will always feel second rate in the .NET world, compared to the Ruby world.</li>
</ul>
