<div style="">I've open sourced&nbsp;<a href="http://undo.io/" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;">undo.io</a>. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/tarr11/undo.io" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;">Here's the github repo</a>.</div>

<div style=""><strong>A place for my text files</strong></div>
<div style="">Undo was just going to be a place on the web for my todo.txt files. &nbsp;It still is that, but I added a bunch of features, some good, and some, well, less good. &nbsp;I wanted something that let me mostly work in text. &nbsp;I am a decent typer, I really like playing with new text editors (hello&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;">Sublime Text</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://notational.net/" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;">Notational Velocity</a>!) &nbsp;I also felt that&nbsp;<a href="http://undo.io/doug/blog/text-files" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;">text was future-proof</a>, so there'd be less concern about what happens to your data if the service goes offline. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="">People often ask me why i called it undo. &nbsp;I wanted to find a way "undo" my todo lists, rethink them, and make them simpler.</div>

<div style=""><strong>A way to learn Rails</strong></div>
<div style="">I've been working on&nbsp;<a href="http://undo.io/" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;">undo.io</a>&nbsp;for about 4 months and it was my first Rails app. &nbsp;I learned a lot (Rails, Linux, Vim, Heroku, etc) and i think I'm a better developer for that.</div>

<div style=""><strong>A hobby is not a business</strong></div>
<div style="">I learned was that undo is not a business - it is a hobby and part of my workflow. &nbsp; &nbsp;I still think productivity is an interesting space and notes in particular are so embryonic, there's always some interest. &nbsp; That's the challenge - I didn't really publicize the tool other than a link or two here and there, and still, people come. &nbsp;I think if you write a note taking app, a core group of passionate people will try it out, and some may even use it long term, just because that's how this product space is. &nbsp;Productivity is a very personal thing - everyone has a different idea on what is right and it's fun to learn about. &nbsp;I still think there's some value to the product and some interesting ideas. &nbsp; &nbsp;I still need a note taking app and this will probably be part of my workflow for some time. &nbsp; &nbsp;I'm putting it up on github since I think it could use some daylight. &nbsp; I also feel like&nbsp;<a href="http://douglastarr.com/we-tweet-in-code" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;">github is my new resume</a>&nbsp;so I'd like my work product to be up there. &nbsp;This isn't my cleanest code but when working as a lean startup, that's probably a good thing.</div>

<div style=""><strong>Existing users</strong></div>
<div style="">Note to existing users: I'm not currently planning on taking it down for the time being. &nbsp;I'd suggest you&nbsp;<a href="http://undo.io/doug/guides/undo/dropbox" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;">sync your notes to Dropbox</a>&nbsp;though. &nbsp;That way, you'll always have a copy of your data.</div>
<p />
<div style=""><strong>Moving!</strong></div>
<div style="">BTW - I am going to be moving my family back to the bay area in July. &nbsp; I'll be really interested in meeting with people to talk about new opportunities and interests. &nbsp;Stuff I'm interested in working on / learning about: big data, hadoop, bayesian networks, statistic programming, NodeJS and js projects in general, mobile development, HTML5 / CSS3, NoSQL. &nbsp;</div>
