<p>I'm going to Failcon 2012 in SF tomorrow and was looking at the <a href="http://failcon2012.eventbrite.com/">eventbrite page</a>&nbsp;and found it was difficult to view all at once.</p>
<p>I created this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnQ7yk92aoNxdFpCOGVDOWdqend0c0ZJY3JrOXZCTkE#gid=0">Google Spreadsheet for the FailCon 2012 Attendee list </a>by scraping that page</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
