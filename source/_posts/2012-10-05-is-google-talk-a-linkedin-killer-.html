title: Is Google Talk a LinkedIn killer?
published: true
---
<div>Google Talk has stealthily become a ubiquitous professional networking and business communications tool. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>If I've ever had a two-way email conversation with someone in GMail, they show up in my GTalk list. &nbsp;I also see people who are in my G+ circles.</div>
<p />
<div>Since then, my Google Talk contacts list has been growing, and is more of a recent representation (but incomplete) representations of my connections than either LinkedIn or Facebook. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>Some of these people I've never met. &nbsp;I've talked to some, once or twice about various business ideas. &nbsp;Some are parents of kids on my soccer team. &nbsp;Others&nbsp;appear because we replied to some threads on various discussion lists.</div>
<p />
<div>Unlike LinkedIn or Facebook, I didn't have to make a decision to formally "connect" with them in order to maintain a relationship. &nbsp;I just had to send them an email, and have them reply.</div>
<p />
<div>I've added a few new contacts on LinkedIn (almost none on Facebook), but there are always new contacts appearing on my GTalk list.</div>
<p />
<div>I get to know someone a bit more personally when they are on a chat list. &nbsp;I see when they are online and off, their G+ profile, their GTalk status update. &nbsp;It's also integrated with email, which is my primary communications tool, which makes it frictionless to send them an IM, email or video chat. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>It's become more important to me to get people on my GTalk list, rather than on my LinkedIn profile.</div>
<p />
<div>How are you using Google Talk for professional networking? &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
