<p>There&#8217;s a lot of noise about teaching kids to code.</p>

<p>People act like it&#8217;s like a basic skill, like reading or writing.</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s a way for kids to express their creativity.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a combination between a team and class.</p>

<p>Teaching kids to code is not a vocational activity, it&#8217;s a creative activity.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not teaching kids to code so that they can get a job.  I&#8217;m teaching them so that they can express their creativity.</p>
