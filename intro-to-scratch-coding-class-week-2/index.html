<div class="entry-content"><p>This was the second week of my <a href="/categories/mvcoders">8 Week Coding Class for 4th Graders</a></p>

<p>This class started a bit more chaotic than the <a href="/coding-class-week-1/">first week</a>.</p>

<h2>Code Club Philosophy</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m not really teaching a class, I&rsquo;m <a href="/3-types-of-programming-classes-for-kids/">running a club</a>, and I don&rsquo;t really care if they learn computer science fundamentals.</p>

<p>I want the kids to:</p>

<ul>
<li>have fun</li>
<li>build things</li>
</ul>


<p>If those two things happen, they&rsquo;ll naturally be more interested.  If they get &ldquo;hooked&rdquo;, they&rsquo;ll be more motiviated to learn more complicated computer science topics.</p>

<h3>Don&rsquo;t worry about how it works.  Just go.</h3>

<p>When learning to drive a car, the focus is on getting the car from point A to point B.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t need to know how to use the defroster, how the automatic transmission functions, or the biography of Enzo Ferrari.</p>

<p>And, unlike a car, it&rsquo;s ok if you write some code and it immediately crashes.</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;m running the class by giving them the keys and letting them drive.  They&rsquo;ll figure out how things work later.</p>

<p>I can tell there is a tremendous sense of empowerment and joy when they realize that they get to do what they want.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a bit chaotic at first, as they start honking the horn, gunning the engine, and laughing uncontrollably.</p>

<p>Fortunately, they don&rsquo;t get into any major accidents.</p>

<h2>Chat</h2>

<p>For one of the classes, I wired up a chat program using <a href="http://togetherjs.com">TogetherJs</a>  The kids LOVED it, but it was big mistake.  As soon as they saw a chat window, they went crazy chatting with each other and paid no attention to me.  TogetherJs is also not just a simple chat program &ndash; it lets each kid control other screens.</p>

<p>As you can imagine&hellip; this didn&rsquo;t work out so well.</p>

<p>It took me about 10 minutes to reel them back in.  I think chat is a valuable tool, but I&rsquo;ll need to rethink how I can use it.</p>

<h2>12 year old app developer</h2>

<p>We watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkd9TWUtFm0">this video about a 12 year old app developer</a>.  The kids <em>kind of</em> liked it, but I think the reception was kind of muted.  We need better videos.</p>

<p>If you know of short videos that might appeal to kids to learn code, please share them in the comments.</p>

<h2>Learning about Loops and Commands</h2>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t really want to spend a lot of time talking, maybe 5 or 10 minutes at most.  It is really hard to have a conversation with them when there are laptops sitting in front of them.</p>

<p>We talked a little bit about loops, commands and programs, and how they fit together.</p>

<p>These kids are all fantastic students.  I can tell that they are all pretty well behaved in the classroom, and they respond to &ldquo;classroom-like&rdquo;&ldquo; questions pretty well.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to have them talk for a few minutes, if only to get them calmed down and thinking about computers.</p>

<h2>Learning Scratch</h2>

<p>This week, we started to use <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">MIT Scratch</a> which is a visual programming environment with a rich curriculum, geared towards children.</p>

<p><img src="http://scratchdaysiegen.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/scratch-cat.jpg" alt="Scratch Logo" /></p>

<p>I decided to run this class mostly by following the <a href="http://cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__1383932368__//pdfs/help/Getting-Started-Guide-Scratch2.pdf">Getting Started</a> intro on the Scratch website.</p>

<p>The Getting Started Tutorial teaches them how to:</p>

<ul>
<li>move a sprite around</li>
<li>manipulate &ldquo;code blocks&rdquo;</li>
<li>use a &ldquo;repeat&rdquo; control block</li>
<li>change sprite colors</li>
<li>make sounds</li>
<li>change backgrounds</li>
<li>response to some basic user input.</li>
</ul>


<p>I had wanted to get further, but it was clear that this was how far we were going to get.</p>

<p>Since some of the kids had &ldquo;played&rdquo; with Scratch before, I let them go faster, so they wouldn&rsquo;t be bored.</p>

<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>

<ul>
<li>Kids should have a mouse. It&rsquo;s really hard to manipulate Scratch with a touchpad.</li>
<li>If some kids get too far ahead, use them as teaching assistants to help the other kids

<ul>
<li>This helps the further ahead kids since they have to explain what they are doing and will learn more.</li>
<li>It helps the other kids catch up.</li>
<li>And it helps me keep control of the class.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Windows 8 is kind of difficult for kids to use.  There are lots of weird swipes that cause the tile screen to show up.</li>
<li>Chromebooks are actually fine.</li>
<li>If you are teaching kids Scratch, these are the things that tripped them up:

<ul>
<li>Separating Blocks and Removing them</li>
<li>Their sprites would fall off the screen, and we had to figure out how to get them back.</li>
<li>They&rsquo;d add some new sprites to the screen and they couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to delete them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By 4th grade, they are all pretty adept at finding videos and images on YouTube.</li>
<li>At the end of the class, I have them type up some notes about what they learned and save them with each lesson.  This helps them think about what they accomplished.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Stories from the kids</h2>

<p>A few kids had used Scratch before and had some &ldquo;tricks&rdquo; up their sleeves.  I saw a few memes I recognized from Reddit.</p>

<p>One of the students in the class learned how to make animations by stringing three drawings together and rotating through them.  Pretty amazing.</p>

<p>A few kids were a little disappointed that we weren&rsquo;t doing CodeCombat again in class.</p>

<h2>On Github</h2>

<p>As with the <a href="/an-open-source-coding-curriculum/">rest of this class</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tarr11/coding-lessons/blob/master/4th-grade-coders/lesson-2.md">This week&rsquo;s curriculum</a> is available on Github.</p>

<h2>Next Week</h2>

<p>Next week the kids are going to team up into groups of 2 and I&rsquo;m going to give them a few challenges using the skills that they learned, and maybe one or two new ones.</p>
