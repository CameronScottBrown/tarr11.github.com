  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been working on a new website called&nbsp;<a href="http://www.featureshot.com">FeatureShot</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve been building apps this past year, I&#8217;ve been overwhelmed at how fast website and apps are innovating. &nbsp;It is really hard to keep up, let alone discover new things or incorporate new trends into products I&#8217;m building.</p>
<p>So, I built a tool that is aimed at developers and product managers who spend a lot of time evaluating new features of websites. &nbsp;It allows you to take screenshots and categorize web and app features.</p>
<p>
<p>It is also a useful tool for anyone who is interested in seeing an &#8220;inside look&#8221; of new apps and website features.</p>
<p>If a product is big and complex enough, it is overwhelming to try and review it. &nbsp;Instead, you want to review a small, digestible part of that feature. &nbsp;I call those reviews &#8221;<strong>FeatureShots&#8221;</strong>&nbsp;- they are simply a few screen grabs of a feature, with a bit of explanation around what it does.</p>
</p>
<p>My vision is to build a comprehensive feature graph that connects these features. &nbsp;That way, you view all the features that make up a product, compare it to other features in other products, and discover new features that you might like. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please <a href="http://www.featureshot.com">check it out</a>, and let me know what you think.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.499999046325684px;">Last friday, I posted my private beta test of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.corpqna.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.499999046325684px;">CorpQNA</a><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.499999046325684px;">&nbsp;on&nbsp;</span><a href="http://seattletechstartups.com/mailman/listinfo/organize" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.499999046325684px;">Seattle Tech Startups</a><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.499999046325684px;">&nbsp;list. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve been on this list for many years, and even though I no longer live in Seattle, I feel like it is one of the most supportive and valuable startup resources I&#8217;ve experienced.</span>
<p />
<p />
<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.499999046325684px;">A couple of people were interested to know in how this offer was received by the community. &nbsp;I&#8217;m just quickly sharing a few stats in case you are thinking of sending an &#8220;early beta&#8221; product announcement of your own via STS. &nbsp;Hopefully you can learn something.</div>
<p />
<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.499999046325684px;">I feel like real numbers are valuable. &nbsp;Because I am bootstrapping this on my own, I don&#8217;t have to ask anyone if I can share these numbers. :)</div>
<p />
<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.499999046325684px;">
<div><strong>50-100</strong>&nbsp;clicked to&nbsp;CorpQNA&#8217;s home page. &nbsp;(I don&#8217;t have exact metrics here, since I didn&#8217;t put a tracking code on the link)</div>
<div><strong>10</strong>&nbsp;people clicked on the &#8220;offer link&#8221;</div>
<div><strong>6</strong>&nbsp;signed up for the beta</div>
<div><strong>5</strong>&nbsp;people emailed offline with feedback</div>
<div><strong>0&nbsp;</strong>people accused me of spamming the list. &nbsp; &nbsp; :)</div>
<p />
<div>I feel pretty good about these numbers. &nbsp;Most of those people have engaged with the product at least once or twice over the past week.</div>
<div>
<p />
<div>Overall, I&#8217;ve got about 15-20 companies signed up at this point. &nbsp; Half of those were just people who signed up and haven&#8217;t come back. &nbsp; &nbsp; The other half are marginally interested. &nbsp; A couple are decently engaged.</div>
<p />
<div>Some other learnings I&#8217;ve had:</div>
<p />
<div><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Spending face to face time with potential users is more valuable than online channels. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong></div>
<div>If you can pitch someone directly, they will just go to your site and signup. &nbsp;You won&#8217;t have to worry about a great landing page yet. &nbsp;This especially important when you are still validating your MVP and don&#8217;t want to spend a lot of time building marketing collateral that may not matter.</div>
<div><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Enterpreneurs are generally more supportive</span></strong></div>
<div>They are willing to try new products, compared to &#8220;normal people&#8221;. &nbsp;I think part of that is because they know how hard it is to get started, part of that is they are very curious about what&#8217;s new in the market. &nbsp;Though they don&#8217;t necessarily represent your target market segment, they are really valuable early adopters.</div>
<p />
<div><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Adwords can be a challenging channel to get beta users</span></strong>.&nbsp;</div>
<div>It costs $15/click in adwords to bid on &#8220;collaboration software&#8221;. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>They have a lot of very immediate &#8220;bounce quality&#8221; metrics and will turn off your keywords if they are not creating a good user experience. &nbsp;I haven&#8217;t focused too much on that landing page experience and it doesn&#8217;t perform well on its own yet. &nbsp; If you aren&#8217;t polished enough, your ad won&#8217;t perform. &nbsp;And if you spend time polishing your ad too much, you aren&#8217;t working on your product. &nbsp;If you are entering an established space., you also either have to pick keywords that are highly qualified (which are expensive), cheap (which are not going to convert) , or undiscovered (which means low volume) &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>The adwords interface can also be a bit overwhelming for a new user. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a &#8220;dashboard&#8221; designed for SEM professionals who spend all day managing keyword spend.<p /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Facebook is a little bit easier</span></strong><br />Facebook has a &#8220;technology early adopter&#8221; segment in their ad tool. &nbsp;This is a nice shortcut and feels like it&#8217;s designed for beta tests. &nbsp;But,&nbsp;If you are going to use Facebook to show ads, don&#8217;t put an ugly logo up there. &nbsp;Put a picture of a person instead. &nbsp;Make sure you have a call to action. &nbsp;Your CPM rates change dramatically based on clickthrough and this stuff helps.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p />
<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.499999046325684px;">If there&#8217;s some stats that you want me to share, or questions/suggestions you&#8217;ve got about CorpQNA, please let me know (via email,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.twitter.com/tarr11" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;">twitter</a>, etc) &nbsp;</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div>My latest company, <a href="http://www.corpqna.com">CorpQNA</a>&nbsp;- Social Q&amp;A For Business, is built (mostly) on the .NET stack. This article explains some of the components I used to pull it together. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div><strong><a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc">ASP.NET MVC</a></strong></div>
<div>If you are still using webforms, wean yourself away. &nbsp;When we first built <a href="http://www.payscale.com">PayScale</a>, we used classic ASP, which was closer to the right model than WebForms was. &nbsp;Later, I made the fateful decision to move to <a href="http://ASP.NET">ASP.NET</a> Webforms. &nbsp;I was not happy with this decision. &nbsp; Trying to debug <a href="http://ASP.NET">ASP.NET</a> Webform Lifecycle events (Page_load vs control_load vs onLoad vs &#8230;) will make your head spin and send you fleeing to Django or Rails.</div>
<p />
<div><strong><a href="http://www.appharbor.com">AppHarbor</a></strong></div>
<div>Right now, I like it better than <a href="https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/scenarios/web-sites/">Azure Websites</a>&nbsp;and cheaper to start with than <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/net/">AWS Elastic Beanstalk</a>. &nbsp;It&#8217;s the option that&#8217;s most like <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a> (which is the gold standard)</div>
<p />
<div><a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsazurewebsitespreview/thread/0218204f-7be3-4586-bfdb-831cde6b7937">Azure Websites doesn&#8217;t support SSL yet</a>. &nbsp;All of your domains have to be on <a href="http://mysite.azurewebsites.com">mysite.azurewebsites.com</a>. &nbsp;Not a good way to project confidence. &nbsp;On the downside, appharbor only supports SNI for SSL ($10 / month) or IP based SSL ($100 / month) &nbsp;Hostname SSL (which Heroku supports for $20 / month) is not yet available. &nbsp; SNI is a problem because older browsers will give warnings when you are trying to use it. &nbsp;I&#8217;m using it, but eventually, I&#8217;ll have to switch. &nbsp;I&#8217;m hoping that AppHarbor catches up before then.</div>
<p />
<div>AppHarbor is aware of your branching schemes, and you can tell it to listen on a particular branch. &nbsp;So if you are pushing to staging, just push your code to a staging branch and AppHarbor will only deploy changes that occur in that branch. &nbsp;AppHarbor also has a continuous integration server built it. &nbsp;If you use NUnit, this saves you time and helps you avoid breaking your site. &nbsp;&nbsp;AppHarbor seems to use <a href="http://support.appharbor.com/discussions/problems/5650-ms-sql-server-shared">SQL Express</a> as it&#8217;s database, which seems like it will be less robust in the long term, than<a href="https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/features/data-management/"> SQL Azure</a>. &nbsp; AWS has an <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/rds/sqlserver/">RDS implementation for SQL Server</a>, but I think it&#8217;s the most expensive of the three.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div><strong><a href="http://bizspark.com/">BizSpark</a></strong></div>
<div>Visual Studio and MS Office for free. &nbsp;The application process is a little bit burdensome but it&#8217;s worth it. &nbsp; There&#8217;s also a lot of goodies attached (free credits on Azure, opportunities for networking, promotion and guidance) so it should be a no brainer.</div>
<p />
<div><strong><a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/fogbugz/">FogBugz</a></strong></div>
<div>An enterprise class bug tracking tool. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve used FogBugz for 8 years now, and it works very well.&nbsp;</div>
<div>It&#8217;s also free for &#8220;startups&#8221;, which means for 2 users or less. &nbsp;So there&#8217;s no reason to not get started on it.</div>
<div>It comes with an integration with Kiln, which is Fog Creek&#8217;s fork of Mercurial + code reviews. &nbsp;I haven&#8217;t much used these features, but it&#8217;s nice to associate my checkins with bugs.</div>
<p />
<div><strong><a href="http://nuget.org/">NuGet</a></strong></div>
<div>Like <a href="http://rubygems.org/">RubyGems </a>for your <a href="http://ASP.NET">ASP.NET</a> application. &nbsp;It&#8217;s super easy to install new functionality in your application. &nbsp;Install-Package EntityFramework and away you go.</div>
<p />
<div><strong><a href="https://github.com/jaredpar/VsVim">VsVim</a></strong></div>
<div>If you haven&#8217;t joined the keyboard revolution (vim, emacs, etc), it&#8217;s time to get your hands off the mouse! &nbsp;You&#8217;ll need to spend a few weeks learning how to use Vim (try the great Vimcasts website to get started). &nbsp;Download vim first. &nbsp;Once you are there, look at ViEmu($) or VsVim(github). &nbsp;These are &#8220;hybrid&#8221; vim solutions. &nbsp;Some commands are still missing and you can&#8217;t use macros, but the core hjkl type navigation is there. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div><strong><a href="https://airbrake.io/">Airbrake</a> and <a href="http://newrelic.com/">NewRelic</a></strong></div>
<div>Stop monitoring your own errors and performance. &nbsp; In the past, we&#8217;ve had to build these tools ourselves (error log monitors) or tried to hook together various open source toolsets (like Ganglia). &nbsp;Do yourself a favor. &nbsp;Until you get an IT professional working full time, use Airbrake and NewRelic. &nbsp;They are free to start and you won&#8217;t think about that stuff for a long time.</div>
<p />
<div><strong><a href="http://www.mailgun.com/">Mailgun </a>or <a href="http://sendgrid.com/">SendGrid</a></strong></div>
<div>Mailgun can send and receive mail for you. &nbsp;If you are hosted anywhere in a cloud environment (AWS, Azure, AppHarbor, Heroku, etc), &nbsp;using a service like Mailgun or SendGrid is a requirement, because otherwise, your email will get marked as spam. &nbsp;Simple as that. &nbsp;You can also you webhooks to let your users use email as an interface into your product (instead of having to visit a website). &nbsp;They also even parse out the junk from your email, so you don&#8217;t have to. &nbsp;(signatures, Subject lines, etc)</div>
<p />
<div><a href="http://www.ninject.org/"><strong>Ninject</strong></a></div>
<div>Ninject is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21288/which-net-dependency-injection-frameworks-are-worth-looking-into">Dependency Injection</a> made easy. &nbsp;There are a lot of frameworks out there for dependency injection. &nbsp;Fortunately, they all require your code to look almost identical (lots of interfaces, avoiding instantiating objects directly). &nbsp;So which ever one you use, it&#8217;s not that hard to swap out for another one. &nbsp;Ninject is super easy to get started with. &nbsp;So if you are no to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921087(v=pandp.20).aspx">IoC </a>or DI, it&#8217;s a good place to start.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>Also, If you are planning on doing any sort of testing, you&#8217;ll need a Dependency Injection Framework. &nbsp;Otherwise, your test setup scripts will start to look like a mess.</div>
<p />
<div><a href="http://nspec.org/"><strong>NSpec</strong></a></div>
<div>Still using <a href="http://www.nunit.org/">NUnit </a>for testing? &nbsp;Time to take a look at NSpec. &nbsp;This is based on the hugely popular RSpec library for Rails. &nbsp;Your tests will be a lot cleaner with NSpec. &nbsp;You can set up elaborate contexts to reproduce difficult errors. &nbsp;It&#8217;s not as supported as NUnit, and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/307895/what-is-the-most-mature-bdd-framework-for-net">there are other BDD Frameworks available</a>&nbsp;which might be better.</div>
<p />
<div><strong><a href="http://Intercom.io">Intercom.io</a></strong></div>
<div>I was looking for a customer feedback tool, and was originally planning on going with UserVoice or GetSatisfaction. &nbsp;But then my friend Lee mentioned Intercom. &nbsp;This is by far the best way to get feedback and communicate 1-1 with your users. &nbsp;It&#8217;s not cheap but if you want a good relationship with your user base, this tool is a must have.</div>
<p />
<div><a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/"><strong>Twitter Bootstrap</strong></a></div>
<div>The pre-eminent framework has lots of best practices built in. &nbsp;In addition to making your website easier to read and navigate, you&#8217;ll learn a lot about usability and design simply by implementing the framework. &nbsp;There&#8217;s also a growing ecosystem of tools, themes, and plug-ins that work with Bootstrap. &nbsp;Bootstrap has also <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/29/bootstraps-maintainers-leave-twitter-for-github-and-obvious-corp-will-move-it-into-its-own-organization/">recently moved into it&#8217;s own foundation</a>, so it should be around for a while.</div>
<p />
<div><strong><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/ef.aspx">Entity Framework</a> or <a href="http://nhforge.org/">NHibernate</a></strong></div>
<div>If you are developing a new MVC application, you are either going to choose Entity Framework or NHibernate. &nbsp;Frankly, for a long time, NHibernate was the better choice. &nbsp;It probably still is if you have classic N-Tier SOA application. &nbsp;It just works better with disconnected datasets. &nbsp;It has better support for caching semantics and more fine grained control over your apps. &nbsp;But it can&#8217;t be a bear to get started with.</div>
<p />
<div>If you are just starting out, Entity Framework with Code First models will get you a long way quickly. &nbsp; The LINQ oriented syntax is clean and easy to understand. &nbsp;But there are still the occasional side effects related to how Entity Framework stores and manages objects under the hood. &nbsp;Hopefully this stuff will get resolved. &nbsp;The EF team seems to iterate very quickly and is able to get language-specific features into the .NET platform.</div>
<p />
<div>The other caveat is it is really hard to switch from one to the other. &nbsp;if you use a Repository pattern, this can help. &nbsp;But a repository pattern doesn&#8217;t really work well with either ORM, and requires a LOT more code. &nbsp;So just plan on sticking with one or the other for a long time.</div>
<p />
<div><strong><a href="http://aboutcode.net/postal/">Postal </a>or <a href="https://github.com/smsohan/MvcMailer">MVC Mailer</a></strong></div>
<div>Rails has <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html">ActionMailer</a>, which lets you write emails using typical MVC semantics. &nbsp;Unfortunately, this is not yet built into <a href="http://ASP.NET">ASP.NET</a> MVC. &nbsp;But there are some good libraries to handle it. &nbsp;I use Postal, which leverages the open source RazorEngine library to create your own Razor views. &nbsp;The syntax is slightly less powerful than Razor for <a href="http://ASP.NET">ASP.NET</a> (ie, no Html helpers, layouts, etc) but it&#8217;s better than concatenating strings together to produce your emails.</div>
<p />
<div><a href="http://getglimpse.com/"><strong>Glimpse</strong></a></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div>Google Talk has stealthily become a ubiquitous professional networking and business communications tool. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>If I&#8217;ve ever had a two-way email conversation with someone in GMail, they show up in my GTalk list. &nbsp;I also see people who are in my G+ circles.</div>
<p />
<div>Since then, my Google Talk contacts list has been growing, and is more of a recent representation (but incomplete) representations of my connections than either LinkedIn or Facebook. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>Some of these people I&#8217;ve never met. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve talked to some, once or twice about various business ideas. &nbsp;Some are parents of kids on my soccer team. &nbsp;Others&nbsp;appear because we replied to some threads on various discussion lists.</div>
<p />
<div>Unlike LinkedIn or Facebook, I didn&#8217;t have to make a decision to formally &#8220;connect&#8221; with them in order to maintain a relationship. &nbsp;I just had to send them an email, and have them reply.</div>
<p />
<div>I&#8217;ve added a few new contacts on LinkedIn (almost none on Facebook), but there are always new contacts appearing on my GTalk list.</div>
<p />
<div>I get to know someone a bit more personally when they are on a chat list. &nbsp;I see when they are online and off, their G+ profile, their GTalk status update. &nbsp;It&#8217;s also integrated with email, which is my primary communications tool, which makes it frictionless to send them an IM, email or video chat. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>It&#8217;s become more important to me to get people on my GTalk list, rather than on my LinkedIn profile.</div>
<p />
<div>How are you using Google Talk for professional networking? &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div style="">I&#8217;ve open sourced&nbsp;<a href="http://undo.io/" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;">undo.io</a>. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/tarr11/undo.io" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;">Here&#8217;s the github repo</a>.</div>
<p />
<div style=""><strong>A place for my text files</strong></div>
<div style="">Undo was just going to be a place on the web for my todo.txt files. &nbsp;It still is that, but I added a bunch of features, some good, and some, well, less good. &nbsp;I wanted something that let me mostly work in text. &nbsp;I am a decent typer, I really like playing with new text editors (hello&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;">Sublime Text</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://notational.net/" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;">Notational Velocity</a>!) &nbsp;I also felt that&nbsp;<a href="http://undo.io/doug/blog/text-files" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;">text was future-proof</a>, so there&#8217;d be less concern about what happens to your data if the service goes offline. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="">People often ask me why i called it undo. &nbsp;I wanted to find a way &#8220;undo&#8221; my todo lists, rethink them, and make them simpler.</div>
<p />
<div style=""><strong>A way to learn Rails</strong></div>
<div style="">I&#8217;ve been working on&nbsp;<a href="http://undo.io/" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;">undo.io</a>&nbsp;for about 4 months and it was my first Rails app. &nbsp;I learned a lot (Rails, Linux, Vim, Heroku, etc) and i think I&#8217;m a better developer for that.</div>
<p />
<div style=""><strong>A hobby is not a business</strong></div>
<div style="">I learned was that undo is not a business - it is a hobby and part of my workflow. &nbsp; &nbsp;I still think productivity is an interesting space and notes in particular are so embryonic, there&#8217;s always some interest. &nbsp; That&#8217;s the challenge - I didn&#8217;t really publicize the tool other than a link or two here and there, and still, people come. &nbsp;I think if you write a note taking app, a core group of passionate people will try it out, and some may even use it long term, just because that&#8217;s how this product space is. &nbsp;Productivity is a very personal thing - everyone has a different idea on what is right and it&#8217;s fun to learn about. &nbsp;I still think there&#8217;s some value to the product and some interesting ideas. &nbsp; &nbsp;I still need a note taking app and this will probably be part of my workflow for some time. &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#8217;m putting it up on github since I think it could use some daylight. &nbsp; I also feel like&nbsp;<a href="http://douglastarr.com/we-tweet-in-code" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;">github is my new resume</a>&nbsp;so I&#8217;d like my work product to be up there. &nbsp;This isn&#8217;t my cleanest code but when working as a lean startup, that&#8217;s probably a good thing.</div>
<p />
<div style=""><strong>Existing users</strong></div>
<div style="">Note to existing users: I&#8217;m not currently planning on taking it down for the time being. &nbsp;I&#8217;d suggest you&nbsp;<a href="http://undo.io/doug/guides/undo/dropbox" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;">sync your notes to Dropbox</a>&nbsp;though. &nbsp;That way, you&#8217;ll always have a copy of your data.</div>
<p />
<div style=""><strong>Moving!</strong></div>
<div style="">BTW - I am going to be moving my family back to the bay area in July. &nbsp; I&#8217;ll be really interested in meeting with people to talk about new opportunities and interests. &nbsp;Stuff I&#8217;m interested in working on / learning about: big data, hadoop, bayesian networks, statistic programming, NodeJS and js projects in general, mobile development, HTML5 / CSS3, NoSQL. &nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Local First</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">With the advent of HTML5, localStorage, mature javascript client libraries, ubiquitous REST APIs and mobile apps, we don&#8217;t need to rely as heavily on cloud providers to develop our applications &nbsp;It&#8217;s time to change how we are writing our apps.</div>
<p />
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://blog.garethjmsaunders.co.uk/wp-content/20070715_cat5.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p />
<p />
<p />
<p />
<div><strong>What is local first?</strong></div>
<div>Similar to <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/mobile-first" target="_blank">mobile-first</a> (where you build your app to work well first on mobile, and then expand out to other devices), <strong>Local First</strong> is the idea that you can build a web app that works first as a disconnected app. &nbsp;You can synchronize to cloud providers if you want, but your app should work locally. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>What are the concepts behind local first?</div>
<p />
<blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">
<div><strong>Cloud-optional</strong></div>
<div>- Your app should still work without cloud storage. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Data-permissions</strong></div>
<div>- User data should not be sent to a cloud provider without permission.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Network-optional</strong></div>
<div>- Once installed, apps should run without need for an internet connection.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Cloud-choice</strong></div>
<div>- Users should be able to choose appropriate cloud providers for data storage.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Cloud-provenance</strong></div>
<div>- Cloud providers should clearly document where your data is stored in understandable language</div>
</blockquote>
<p />
<div><strong>Why Local First?</strong></div>
<div>There are many reasons to build your apps local first. &nbsp;Performance and Stability, User Adoption, and Privacy</div>
<p />
<blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">
<div><strong>Performance and Stability</strong></div>
<div>Local apps will have less dependency on network calls. &nbsp; &nbsp;This will (usually) make them perform better. &nbsp;If your network goes down, or is slow, firewalled, or otherwise encumbered, your app still works. &nbsp; Less headaches for you as a developer.</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://edwardcheever.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/cat-internet-failure.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p />
<div><strong>Adoption</strong></div>
<div>Users are increasingly concerned with their privacy. &nbsp;Your application is probably losing users since they are uncomfortable with how you are using their data. &nbsp;Many corporate networks simply will not allow your data to be stored on cloud providers (other than their own networks). &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<p />
<blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">
<div><strong>Government privacy concerns</strong></div>
<div>Government snooping continues to increase. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a losing battle (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PROTECT_IP_Act" target="_blank">PIPA</a>, <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/254836/mozilla_criticizes_cispa_for_having_broad_alarming_reach.html" target="_blank">CISPA</a>) to fight governments who are intent on monitoring our internet usage and data. &nbsp;As <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304299304577349783428104546.html?mod=googlenews_wsj" target="_blank">more governments gain control of the internet</a> (with different points of view on the importance of free speech and privacy), your data will be in more hands. &nbsp; &nbsp;By all means, let&#8217;s continue to slow them down. But more importantly, let&#8217;s make sure our data is not centralized. &nbsp;</div>

<p />
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.eweekeurope.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/darth-vader.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p />
<div><strong>What&#8217;s next?</strong></div>
<div>The idea here is that this is not a centralized approach, so the conversation shouldn&#8217;t be centralized as well. &nbsp; As a developer, the next thing is to try and build an app this way. &nbsp;Don&#8217;t start with a SQL database and server application. &nbsp;Start with a client application that works without the cloud. &nbsp;&nbsp;If you&#8217;ve already been doing this, share how you do it. &nbsp;Post your code. &nbsp; &nbsp;Use #localfirst in your tweets, or somewhere in your posts, so we can track local first activity. &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div><strong>What I&#8217;m going to do next</strong></div>
<div>I&#8217;ve built my latest app <a href="http://undo.io">undo.io</a> in rails as a web-first app. &nbsp;I&#8217;m going to spend a few weeks flipping it to local first. &nbsp;I&#8217;ll share how that works on my blog&nbsp;</div>

<div>Are you a developer or tech type? &nbsp;You probably have a twitter account (here&#8217;s <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/tarr11">mine</a>). &nbsp;You might even have a <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/douglastarr">LinkedIn account</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>Do you have a <a href="https://github.com/tarr11">github account</a>? &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>Ever since I&#8217;ve started to work on <a href="http://undo.io">undo.io</a>, I&#8217;ve started attending lots of events and taking a fresh look at the job market. &nbsp;I noticed the trend a few months ago after attending some Seattle&nbsp;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Seattle-Ruby-on-Rails-Developers-Meetup-Group/events/61100872/">Rails</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Node-js/">NodeJS</a> events. &nbsp;As I&#8217;m relatively new to the openstack community (coming from windows/.NET) I&#8217;ve been asking for quite a bit of help (people have been really awesome by the way when you ask). &nbsp;The most helpful things I&#8217;ve found are where someone points me to a relevant repo on github. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>[[posterous-content:YGVV51uDG94liahxTeUr]]</div>
<p />
<div>Github has infected many conversations I have with developers now. &nbsp;Developers don&#8217;t say &#8220;follow me on twitter&#8221; or &#8220;check out my linkedin account&#8221;. &nbsp;Instead, they&#8217;d point you to their github account, so you could see their latest nodejs project, &nbsp;.vimrc or DCPU-16 hack.</div>
<p />
<div>Code is how developers communicate, and feel most comfortable. &nbsp;Compared to how much we code, we don&#8217;t really email, tweet, post status updates, or blog posts. &nbsp;README files and comments in code are where we make our jokes, and we define ourselves in terms of languages we know, operating systems, or text editors. &nbsp;(Don&#8217;t believe me? ask a dev about any one of those topics, see if you can get them to shut up)</div>
<p />
<div>[[posterous-content:7FGDz0WIFFekFHQ8Jwzz]]</div>
<p />
<div>There are an increasing number of forms that have asked for my github account as a supplement to a traditional resume or linkedin profile. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a really great way to find out who you are as a developer, and what you are interested in. &nbsp;Even if you aren&#8217;t committing to a major project, looking at what you are watching, in which areas, is incredibly valuable.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>As a hiring manager, it lessens the need for code samples or programming interviews. &nbsp;After all, there&#8217;s your code, right up there on github. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>[[posterous-content:HNjHg0heI81v8CtqgF38]]</div>
<div>Having an active github account doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;ll <a href="https://github.com/seomoz/ruby-job-application ">get the next job</a>, <a href="http://gun.io/blog/get-freelance-jobs-based-on-your-github-profile/">contract</a>&nbsp;or <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/s2012form">round of funding</a>.</div>
<p />
<div>But if you don&#8217;t have one? &nbsp;You might get disqualified altogether <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/82973/how-would-you-assess-a-programmers-github-profile">without even knowing it</a>.</div>
