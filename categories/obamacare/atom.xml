    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I applied for insurance on the CoveredCA site a few weeks ago (in November).</p>

<p>The coveredca plan pricing was significantly better than what was available under the &ldquo;individual insurance&rdquo; page on their site.</p>

<p>That said, neither CoveredCA nor Anthem has had any contact with me, and I have been calling them weekly.</p>

<p>If you call them, expect long wait times.  Also, the &ldquo;online chat&rdquo; feature on CoveredCA simply doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p>If you have been having problems, here&rsquo;s what they told me:</p>

<ul>
<li>They are behind on processing applications since they haven&rsquo;t received them from CoveredCA.</li>
<li>They receive new applications from CoveredCA every Friday, so that&rsquo;s a good time to check if they have your application.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a lot of people looking for help / stressed out on the <a href="http://facebook.com/coveredca">CoveredCA facebook page</a>  There seem to be some representatives of CoveredCA there, but they don&rsquo;t seem to be able to help individuals.</li>
<li>If you were approved on the CoveredCA site for an Anthem plan, and you have your case # and application # (which should be available on your CoveredCA account), then you can send your payment with case# / application# and they will process it.</li>
</ul>
