<h2>Laying down a gauntlet</h2>

<p>I have been in the habit of starting the kids with <a href="http://codecombat.com">CodeCombat</a>, which is a game that teaches JavaScript programming by making you solve a series of puzzles with code.</p>

<p>This is a bit risky; CodeCombat is kind of hard, and a bit frustrating, especially for kids in elementary school.  But, it is a lot of fun.  The graphics and music are great, there&rsquo;s a real narrative that draws the kids in, and it treats them with respect.  I was drawn to it because it wasn&rsquo;t easy.  I didn&rsquo;t want the kids to start off on something easy, and then have it just keep getting harder, only to have them have a false sense of accomplishment and get discouraged.</p>

<p>So far, this has worked out fairly well.  I try to keep a fine balance between keeping the kids challenged and excited.  What also helps is a social atmosphere; perhaps you might be having a tough problem, but you can always walk over and talk to your friend, and perhaps work on something else together.</p>

<h2>Computational Thinking</h2>

<p>In a sense, this game (and coding in general) is a kind of initiation into a special club called <a href="http://www.google.com/edu/computational-thinking/">computational thinking</a>   This is a way of thinking that allows you to communicate and instruct computers to do what you want.</p>

<p>Computational Thinking is valuable for anyone to learn.  We live in a world of machines &ndash; this is probably the first or second generation of humans in which computers will outnumber human beings.  Ie, at what point will the entire population of the earth own at least one electronic device?  I can probably count hundreds of different micro-processors in my own home.</p>

<p>So, in one sense, there&rsquo;s a larger trend towards making machines more accessible to humans.  Companies like Apple and Google are building user interfaces that try and intuit human needs and build interfaces geared towards humans.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also a trend towards people <em>adapting human behavior to computers</em>.  An obvious example is language, which changes almost daily and is shaped by our interaction with texting, iPhones and Twitter.  Another example is trying to fix your broken computer.  You can&rsquo;t simply yell at it and fix it (though this would be a fantastic product, aspiring entrepreneurs)  Instead, you have to <em>think like the computer would</em> and solve the problem that way.</p>

<p>It can be incredibly frustrating when a machine breaks or is hard to use, and you need it to do something.  By thinking &ldquo;like the machine does&rdquo;, you can be empowered to solve your own computer problems, even if you are never going to be a programmer.</p>

<h2>Tynker</h2>

<p>This week we tried out <a href="http://www.tynker.com">Tynker</a> in the classroom.  I would call this a &ldquo;mixed success&rdquo;.  Some of the kids really liked it.  In particular, I had one or two kids who liked the Physics engine (a differentiator from <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> ) However, many of the kids who were familiar with Scratch liked it less.  They sort of viewed as &ldquo;Scratch where everything got moved around&rdquo;.  That was interesting to see &ndash; once the kids are comfortable in a tool, it can be hard to make them learn a similar tool unless it offers a significantly altered feature set.</p>

<p>My plan is to incorporate many different tools and platforms into the class.  Just this week, I heard about a few new tools I&rsquo;d like to check out such as <a href="http://www.sploder.com">Sploder</a> and <a href="http://www.checkio.org">Checkio</a></p>

<h2>Code Club Updates</h2>

<p>At this point, I am running 5 different classes over 4 days with 34 kids.  My original plan was to talk about everyone&rsquo;s progress here on this blog.  However, I don&rsquo;t think that will make as much sense, since we are working on a lot of different things.  Even in the original Wednesday group, kids are working on a variety of things.   I&rsquo;m working on a better solution that gives more personalization progress reports about each class and student.</p>

<h2>Computer Hygiene</h2>

<p>There was a nasty bug going around at the schools in the past week.  I&rsquo;ll be encouraging kids to wash their hands before and after class.  I will also be wiping down keyboards and mice with anti-bacterial wipes so as to avoid spreading germs.  Please let me know if you have any other ideas that might help keep our kids healthy and safe.</p>

<h2>Thoughts on Summer Camp</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spoken to a few parents; my thinking right now is that I will offer slightly more extended sessions (maybe 2-3 hours max per day) in the summer, but not entire day long sessions as this is too much screen time, especially in the summer.</p>

<h2>Middle School</h2>

<p>The middle school initiative is picking up steam.  The idea is to take a group of Middle School students and build something cool, like an app or a game.   We are going to have an exploratory session soon.  If you are interested in participating, please email me.</p>

<h2>Minecraft For Parents Q&amp;A</h2>

<p>So, I have heard from parents about Minecraft specific questions.  Things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is Minecraft?   Why is my kid addicted to it?</li>
<li>What age is appropriate for Minecraft?</li>
<li>How do I keep my child safe?</li>
<li>Can Minecraft cause problems with my computer?  What kind of computer do I need?</li>
<li>How do I monitor my child&rsquo;s activity on Minecraft Servers?</li>
</ul>


<p>I am thinking about having a Q&amp;A session at Code Club for parents about Minecraft.  I&rsquo;d imagine I&rsquo;d have a 30 minute presentation on &ldquo;Minecraft for Parents&rdquo; followed by a Q&amp;A / roundtable session where we can discuss the various issues we&rsquo;ve had around it.   If you are interested in participating, please let me know!</p>

    <link href="http://douglastarr.com/a-new-year-of-coding/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-12T07:33:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://douglastarr.com/a-new-year-of-coding</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week, we started the new year with one new coding class, and the two additional ones.  By the end of the week, we had two more classes, including our first girls-only class.  So, we&rsquo;ve gone from 12 coders to almost 30.</p>

<p>So, thank you all for participating and recommending the Mill Valley Code Club to your friends.  I know it wouldn&rsquo;t be here without your support and enthusiasm.</p>

<h2>On Using Scratch</h2>

<p>When I first started code club, I was not sure which platform to use.  I use Code Combat in the first session, which is a fun way to get kids excited about coding.</p>

<p>However, I eventually chose Scratch as a tool to use, since it seemed the most mature tool.  I had been hearing good things about Tynker, but I didn&rsquo;t choose it initially because it was going to add costs to the class, and I needed to learn for myself what the curriculum was going to be like.</p>

<p>The first mvcoders I had join were mostly an outgrowth of Elijah&rsquo;s soccer team &ndash; more than half the kids came from that group.  More than half of them liked Minecraft.  Since it was a bit more uniform, it made sense to teach the same curriculum to all of them.  Our goal in that class was to make a video game.  This resonated with most of the kids as that was something that they wanted to do.</p>

<p>The intro class was geared towards getting kids to understand the Scratch platform, and also to start thinking about solving problems in a new way.  Coding requires you to plan ahead, and by the end of the first session, most of the kids had figured out how to orchestrate sophisticated games and anmiations.</p>

<h2>CodeCombat and Jumping</h2>

<p>The Monday coders started off with CodeCombat, just as the first group did last time.  We had a blast slaying ogres!  At some point, some of the kids were getting stuck, and I said &ldquo;I know this can be a little frustrating&rdquo;.  Then, I was corrected &ndash; &ldquo;No, not frustrating.  Just challenging!&rdquo;  That&rsquo;s the attitude!</p>

<p>I wanted to have the Wednesday kids explore some basic physics motions so that their games could feel more realistic.  Turns out, teaching physics to 4th and 5th graders is not so easy!   They still haven&rsquo;t mastered negative numbers and coordinates, and they haven&rsquo;t been much introduced to Physics concepts in class yet.  So, we spent some time talking about speed, velocity and acceleration.   We learned that when you jump, your speed goes to zero at the top of your jump.</p>

<p>These concepts are not easy;  it may take a few sessions to get the hang of it.  However, if they can master jumping in their code, they will be ready for more advanced Math and Science classes at school.</p>

<p><img src="/images/angry-birds.jpg" alt="Angry Birds" /></p>

<h2>Different Strokes</h2>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve watched the kids learn to code, I&rsquo;ve noticed that there are several different learning styles that the kids fall into.  I&rsquo;ve been trying to create a program that allows each of these types of kids to have a good experience.</p>

<h3>The Curious Explorer</h3>

<p>These kids love to try new things.  They are always pushing the platform to it&rsquo;s limits, kicking the tires, and seeing what it can do.  These are the kids who not only have tried Scratch, but are interested in Javascript, Python, Ruby and even Unity 3D!</p>

<h3>The Digital Artist</h3>

<p>Some kids come to coding with either an artistic or musical interest.  They spend much of their time perfecting animations, creating music, using vector drawing tools and illustrating.</p>

<h3>The Hardcore Hacker/Gamer</h3>

<p>The hacker and gamer (two separate categories for adults) loves to play.  They are adept at taking pieces of things and mashing them together in new ways.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to cater to each group more specifically.  I think it would be fun to try out new tools for our explorers, maybe do some advanced Photoshop, Illustrator (and Garage Band??) for the Artists, and encourage the hackers to dream up new takes on existing games.</p>

<h2>Trying out Tynker</h2>

<p>Starting this week, I am going to mix in some Tynker sessions as well.  The interface to Tynker is not that different from Scratch, and it has some good tools for creating curriculums for kids, while still letting the different &ldquo;coder-types&rdquo; have a good time.  It will also make it easier to create coding curriculums that satisifies kids with different interests and who work at different paces.</p>

<h2>Socializing and Coding</h2>

<p>Collaboration and socializing are an important part of code club.  I had the Monday class wear headphones the whole time.  I did this because some of the Wednesday classes had gotten too noisy, and I wanted to cut that down a bit.  However, the kids in the Monday class were simply too quiet!  So, I think this week, we&rsquo;ll probably have headphones, but mainly for when we need to concentrate.</p>

<h2>Debugging and Unblocking</h2>

<p>I see one of my main jobs in code club as &ldquo;Chief Debugger&rdquo;.  Perhaps your child is doing some coding at home;  it can be tough when they run into problems and you don&rsquo;t really have the time or knowledge to help them solve them.</p>

<p>A key value of code club is helping kids get past roadblocks.  Every software package has bugs and issues that make it less than perfect.  For new coders, hitting a roadblock in your coding adventure can be incredibly frustrating.  There&rsquo;s so much to learn, and you are excited about it, but trying to figure out how to solve technical problems can be time consuming and require a lot of patience.</p>

<h2>Summer Code Camp</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard from several parents that they are interested in a Marin Code Camp this summer for their kids.  I&rsquo;m considering doing that.  However, I doubt that I would run &ldquo;full-day&rdquo; sessions as I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s appropriate for kids this age to be on the computer all day long.   However, I think, because they won&rsquo;t be in school, that having slightly longer sessions might make sense.  Please let me know if you are interested or have any thoughts on it.</p>

<h2>Helping Out</h2>

<p>I am looking to hire a few coding tutors to help out in the class. It&rsquo;s perfect for high school or college students who have done some coding and enjoy working with kids.  If you know of anyone who might be interested, please let me know!</p>

<h2>Thoughts and Comments?</h2>

<p>For many parents, code club is a new experience.  I welcome your comments and feedback either here or by emailing me directly.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Part of the reason that I started the Mill Valley Code Club was to give me an outlet to do stuff that would otherwise seem totally ridiculous.</p>

<p><img src="/images/quadcopter.png" alt="Quadrocopter" /></p>

<p>I have this idea that I could build a quadrocopter with a GoPro, that could fly from the Mill Valley Square, up to the top of Mount Tamalpais.</p>

<p>It would have a GoPro attached and we could get a First Person View (FPV) of that trip.</p>

<p>Not sure if the quadrocopter has that kind of range.</p>

<p>As I learn more about how this goes, I&rsquo;ll post using the <a href="/categories/mvcopter">mvcopter</a> category.</p>

<p>If you are interested in helping out, let me know!  I&rsquo;ll probably working on this at the Mill Valley Code Club every once in a while.</p>

    <link href="http://douglastarr.com/working-on-our-scratch-game-week-7/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-14T09:50:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://douglastarr.com/working-on-our-scratch-game-week-7</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The promise of this class is that kids would have their own working game.  So, this week, they just got to work on their game using all that they knew about Scratch.</p>

<p>Everyone worked on their individual games, and I saw some really cool ideas.</p>

<p>Rather than talk to much about the class, I&rsquo;ve started to reflect on what I&rsquo;ve learned about teaching coding.</p>

<p><img src="/images/scratch-code.png" alt="Scratch Code" /></p>

<h2>Learnings</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Laptops are hard for kids to code on.  We hit lots of frustrating bugs related to slow latops, using touchpads, and weird browser interactions.</p></li>
<li><p>The kids love Scratch!   It lets them express their creativity in a new way.</p></li>
<li><p>Most of the problems in class happen when their code &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t work&rdquo;.  Then, they are completely blocked.  Sometimes, it&rsquo;s not obvious (even to me) what happened and why it doesn&rsquo;t work, and can take me a while to figure it out.    As they try to build more sophisticated programs, the problems get harder to solve.</p></li>
<li><p> Kids enjoy coding together &ndash; they are always looking at what each other is working on and makes it more fun.</p></li>
<li><p>Scheduling is painful.  Every child has so much to do in their schedule, and they want to be in class with a particular set of other kids, and it quickly turns into a very hard math problem.   I&rsquo;ve got a set of other kids who might want to participate, but I am having trouble integrating the schedules effectively.</p></li>
<li><p>Coding is more than just computer science math.  Kids are spending a lot of their time making songs, drawing, creating little &ldquo;theatrical animations&rdquo;.</p></li>
<li><p>There&rsquo;s a lot of math that they haven&rsquo;t yet learned in school.  They have to master Cartesian coordinates, how to manipulate negative numbers, and a lot of other things.  So, I find myself teaching a lot of math so that you can get your game to have a character jump up and down.</p></li>
<li><p>We probably don&rsquo;t need to &ldquo;move on&rdquo; from Scratch for a while.  There is a lot to do there and I think it will take some time to master.</p></li>
<li><p>Different kids like different things.  I&rsquo;ve got a few kids who love performing, music and singing, and they spend a lot of their time making &ldquo;arrangements&rdquo;.  Some others just love hacking on video games.  Some are just naturally curious and enjoy learning technologies.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>Next week is our final week of this 8 week class, and hopefully the kids will feel like it was enjoyable and that they learned some new things about computers and programming.</p>

<p>We are going to start a new session in the new year, and I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that 100% of the kids are going to continue to participate.   Based on what I&rsquo;ve learned, I&rsquo;m working on some changes that I think will make the experience better.  Stay tuned, I&rsquo;ll announce those next week.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Clones and variables - Coding Class Week 6]]></title>
    <link href="http://douglastarr.com/clones-and-variables-coding-class-week-6/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-06T08:58:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://douglastarr.com/clones-and-variables-coding-class-week-6</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week was a bit of a stretch.  I wanted to teach the kids about clones.  This is a concept that&rsquo;s used fairly extensively in video games.</p>

<h2>Video</h2>

<p>We watched this video &ndash; someone basically modeled minecraft in a 3D toolkit.  I wanted them to see clones and physics in action.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://douglastarr.com//www.youtube.com/embed/o702In0aI5E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<h2>Clones</h2>

<p><img src="/images/clones.jpg" alt="Clones" /></p>

<p>Clones are copies of things.  The kids have been learning to make a game, but the games tend to have very few characters, and they have to script them out individually.  This can be tedious and still feel fairly manual.</p>

<p>Part of the magic of coding is when you start building lots of objects that interact with each other.   Much of this involves math and physics, so that you can simulate bouncing, gravity, and other real world phenomena.</p>

<p>However, I figured that the kids would be far enough along that they could try.</p>

<h2>Shoot the Penguin</h2>

<p><img src="/images/shoot-the-penguin.png" alt="Shoot the penguin" /></p>

<p>We were going to make a simple game  &ndash; I just called it &ldquo;Shoot the Penguin&rdquo;.  Make a gun, make a bullet, make a penguin.   If the bullet touches the penguin, the penguin dies.</p>

<p>I gave them an example of a gun that shoots a bullet.  Some of the kids had previously figured out how to do this; They had a gun sprite and a bullet sprite and when they hit the space bar, the bullet sprite started moving until it hit the edge.</p>

<h2>Direction, Position, and Variables</h2>

<p>At some point, most of the kids had figured out how to make the gun shoot a bullet, and even kill the penguin.</p>

<p>Then, the next goal was to aim the gun.   This was useful because the kids naturally start complaining that their gun doesn&rsquo;t work too well, since it won&rsquo;t aim, and the bullet sometimes doesn&rsquo;t shoot out of the gun.  So, we had to create some global variables to store the position of the gun, and then copy those to the bullet so that the bullet knew which direction to go.</p>

<h2>Scratch Limitations, and Bugs</h2>

<p>Scratch is very &ldquo;opionated&rdquo;, and only comes with a subset of features available in modern programming languages.  It&rsquo;d be better if it was more object oriented, such that I could query the gun&rsquo;s position, instead of copying into a global variable.  This would have been more natural for the kids to understand.  Copying around variables around is a little bit confusing and messy.</p>

<p>We also ran into some bugs &ndash; sprites would just simply not rotate correctly sometimes, and we had to delete them and re-add them.  It was also common for kids to build a complicated sprite, but put it in the wrong place (ie, as a backdrop or as a costume attached to a different sprite)  When they finally realized they did it wrong, they had no idea how to move it.</p>

<p>We finally figured out that you do it by downloading the sprite to your local computer, then uploading again.  Copy/paste would have been better.</p>

<p>Also, renaming variables and sprites tends to break script blocks, which don&rsquo;t update their references always.  So, either name your variables and sprites up front, or don&rsquo;t bother.</p>

<h2>Next Week</h2>

<p>I keep meaning to let the kids just build in class, and not really teach them anything.  I think for the last 2 weeks, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll do.  They can be creative, and I&rsquo;ll just help them as they finish their &ldquo;final projects&rdquo;.</p>
