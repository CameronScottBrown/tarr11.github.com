title: Just sort of hard to use

The workflow is just much more labor intensive than a tweet I guess.  

I'm using the Github UI to author the pages and am trying to set up jekyll to do this nicely.

Workflow looks like:
 * Author new markdown page on github pages
 * Publish page
 * Go find the URL of new page, and paste it into indiewebify.me

One problem I have is that webmention.herokuapp.com is calling me "unknown" when I reply.  

I feel like something is wrong with my page markup but not quite sure what.
