<div class="entry-content"><p>Advising startups is an industry.  People seem to go into it when they don&rsquo;t have a startup going on, or they don&rsquo;t have the energy to get back into startups.  Occasionally, they do it because they want to keep tabs on a startup, either to invest or to join.  These are all decent reasons.</p>

<p>However, you shouldn&rsquo;t call yourself a startup advisor unless you have had a successful startup.  You can call yourself an entrepreneur, but only if you&rsquo;ve founded a company of some kind.  You can&rsquo;t call yourself an entrepreneur if you just want to found a company.  That&rsquo;s just called an &ldquo;employee&rdquo;.</p>

<p>If I were to advise startups, most of my advice would be &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; with an occasional &ldquo;go ahead and try and let me know how it goes&rdquo;. That way I could take credit for the things that work and disavow all the failures.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t currently advise other startups because I have nothing of much value to tell them.  If they are smart, they might figure it out.  If they aren&rsquo;t smart, they might get lucky.  In either case, my advice will not be predictive of their success.</p>

<p>A startup advisor is really more of a therapist then a mentor.  This often requires age and wisdom.</p>

<p>Successful startup advisors don&rsquo;t keep honest track records.  Highlight your wins, delete your losses.  This is the same technique that investors use.</p>

<p>Of course, the best startup advice is this - don&rsquo;t listen to startup advice.</p>
