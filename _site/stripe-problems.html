<h1>Problems I have with Stripe Recurring Billing</h1>

<h2> No support for cash, checks, or ACH.</h2>

<p>If you have to support payment types that they don't (cash, check, or ACH), you end up rewriting everything.  It's easier to have a recurring task to bill every day and dispatch to stripe, ach, etc.  Coupons, credits and invoices all need to be duplicated by payment method.</p>

<h2> Credits and coupons don't work with non-invoiced item</h2>

<p>You can only have one invoice per subscription so you have to create a second subscription instead of just charging their card and expecting it to respect credits.</p>

<h2> Changing prices is painful.  </h2>

<p>Stripe's plans are immutable so if you need to raise prices, you need a new plan.  Over time you end up with lots of plans that all look almost identical, except for their prices.</p>
