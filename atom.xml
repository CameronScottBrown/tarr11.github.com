    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of research on how to effectively make a curriculum for the 4th Graders that I am teaching.  Turns out, it&rsquo;s not easy!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been struggling to figure out what my role is in this experience.  For example, there are many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOCs</a> (<a href="http://khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a>, <a href="http://codeacademy.com">Code Academy</a> ) out there that essentially provide a self-directed learning environment.  There are some hybrid environments like <a href="http://tynker.com">Tynker</a> that provide a more structured environment which helps teachers run a larger class, but still get into some depth around programming.  It would be a waste of time for me to have them just simply turn on computers and point them at Khan Academy.</p>

<p>My experience watching my children try to use these tools is that they work well for everything &hellip; except programming.  It is really hard to make a perfectly self-contained, understandable, modular programming environment where the kids don&rsquo;t go off the rails.  That said &ndash; they are great to use when someone can help get past roadblocks, bugs in software, and design issues that make the software confusing. I think online or self-directed curricula are very important, but I think that if kids (especially younger kids) are left to their own on these programs, they will get stuck and discouraged, even with the best designed programs.</p>

<p>So, where does that leave us?  Can we adopt an online curriculum for our class or do we have to build our own?<br/>
There are some curricula out there, especially built around tools like <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">MIT Scratch</a>.
The curriculum you use or develop is highly dependent on the kind of structure you put towards your class.  This stuff is probably pretty obvious to anyone who has been involved professionally in education (teachers, etc) but it&rsquo;s a new discovery for me.</p>

<p>I would categorize the curriculum into 3 groups (classes, teams, and clubs)</p>

<h2>The Class</h2>

<p>The entire class is going to be learning the exact same thing, at the same time.  This seems to be the model taken by schools.  It&rsquo;s also a valuable way to go if you have a large group of kids (more than 8 or 10) since you really won&rsquo;t have the time to give them individual attention.  You are trading some creativity and self-direction for scale.  It&rsquo;s also harder to get kids to be excited by a class.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<p>You are teaching them some skills but there&rsquo;s a lot of free time and everyone need not learn the same thing.  There&rsquo;s a concept of working together as a team and collaborating.  Teams can be smaller, and different kids can specialize in different areas.  There&rsquo;s a sense of grouping by age and at the end of the &ldquo;season&rdquo; you should have learned some valuable skills.  You might have a competition or challenge as well.</p>

<h2>The Club</h2>

<p>You are there to provide some resources and keep everyone moving forward, but it&rsquo;s more self-directed.  My guess is that this model works really well in high school, where the kids have self-selected into wanting to participate and have the ability to solve more in depth problems on their own.  You are offering lots of opportunities and an environment for individual creativity and collaboration.</p>

<p>For the <a href="http://douglastarr.com/categories/mvcoders">MVCoders</a> group, I am going to use the &ldquo;Team&rdquo; approach since I am dealing with a small group of motivated kids.</p>

<h2>Future Questions To Address</h2>

<ul>
<li>Visual Programming Languages (ie, Scratch) vs Text based Languages (javascript)</li>
<li>What is an appropriate amount of &ldquo;help&rdquo; to give students</li>
<li>As a developer, how much custom code should I be writing myself?</li>
<li>What is the relationship of a coding class to other traditional classes?</li>
<li>What expectations does everyone (parents, kids, teachers, etc) have for the class?</li>
</ul>

    <updated>2013-10-12T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://douglastarr.com/Teaching-Coding-to-4th-graders</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to teach coding to some 4th graders after school, including my son and about 7 other kids.</p>

<p>My background is as a software developer, but teaching is new to me.</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;m planning on writing some blog entries to keep notes on what I&rsquo;ve learned and how I&rsquo;m structuring the class.  You can follow along about it using the <a href="http://douglastarr.com/categories/mvcoders">mvcoders</a> tag in my blog.</p>

<p>My son really enjoys Minecraft, to the point where he religiously watches every &ldquo;How-To&rdquo; video on YouTube about fun ways to use Redstone and Command Blocks to do neat things.</p>

<p>I really want to encourage kids to have fun programming.  It is so much different now and there are a ton of resources to use that don&rsquo;t require kids to get immersed in the guts of the OS to learn some basic coding.</p>

<p>My challenge has been to find a good curriculum to teach, and figure out how to best structure for the class so that all of the kids have a great experience.</p>

<p>Resources I&rsquo;m looking at using:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> &ndash; This is a visual programming language with a very active community, centered around making games.   There&rsquo;s a lot of resources to help make the class.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/cs">Khan Academy CS</a> &ndash; There is a great new environment in Khan Academy that helps kids learn javascript.  My sense is this would be good for some of the advanced kids.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">CodeAcademy</a> &ndash; Similar to Khan Academy, this site helps people learn javascript (and other languages) in a step by step environment.</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;ve also been intrigued by using MineCraft directly in the class.  You can do a lot of interesting programming and logic exercises simply by using Redstone and Command Blocks.  That said, there&rsquo;s no real guard rails here and I&rsquo;m pretty sure as soon as I let the kids go play MineCraft, they&rsquo;d go off and do whatever they wanted.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s an open source / javascript version of MineCraft called <a href="http://voxeljs.com/">Voxel.js</a>.  I&rsquo;ve tried this with my son, and though it was cool, I am not sure it&rsquo;ll work for a class.  It looks very similar to Minecraft but doesn&rsquo;t have all the features.  I am a bit worried that they will be disappointed by this.  I like it because it will get them to learn a greater part of the coding toolchain (node.js, text editors, html5, javascript, etc) whereas tools like Scratch hide all of that.  I might introduce it later in the cycle if the kids find Scratch too limiting.  Similarly, there are a lot of open source javascript frameworks for gaming.  I haven&rsquo;t looked too closely into these so I&rsquo;m not sure that they&rsquo;ll work.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also looking into &ldquo;physical&rdquo; devices such as Arduino, Lego Mindstorm, or Raspberry Pi to introduce hardware concepts and give them something real to play with.   This might be too ambitious for this class (which is only one day a week for 1.5 hours after school) so perhaps I will do that in another class.</p>

<p>If you know of any other resources (around curriculum, tools, or generally understanding the mindset of a 4th grader), please share in the comments!</p>

    <id>http://douglastarr.com/Ideas-are-a-virus-but-not-in-a-good-way</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I&rsquo;ve gone from one startup to another, I&rsquo;ve tended to think of ideas as &ldquo;viral&rdquo;.</p>

<p>What I thought that meant was that they spread from one person to the next.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve come to understand that ideas are more than just a meme that spreads from person to person, destined to provide fame and riches.</p>

<p>Ideas can be destructive, and foolish, and completely irrational.</p>

<p>Like the flu, once an idea takes hold, it can be hard to get rid of.</p>

<p>You get a fever, you can&rsquo;t see clearly, and you often don&rsquo;t make sense to others.  You might even be hallucinating.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really a kind of sickness.  Many founders will often describe themselves as kind of insane, or ill, or something.</p>

<p>They will hallucinate that they are changing the world.</p>

<p>So, be careful about letting your startup idea consume you completely.  You&rsquo;ll get sick and distracted and the fever may not break for months or years.</p>

    <id>http://douglastarr.com/A-simple-way-to-save-time-at-work</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to create a list of questions and answers that people commonly ask you at work.</p>

<p>This will save you time and some grief from constant interruption.</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a page or document somewhere (any tool will do), and call it &ldquo;My FAQ&rdquo;.  (Obviously replace &ldquo;My&rdquo; with our name)</li>
<li>Add it to your email signature as a link, and whatever other social tools people can discover you by (your GChat handle, etc)</li>
<li>When new questions come in from people (from any channel), make sure to write them down in your FAQ first.  Then, instead of answering them directly, send a link to the appropriate FAQ article.</li>
<li>Put a link on your FAQ to prompt people to say &ldquo;Thanks&rdquo;.  This will encourage you to keep up your FAQ.</li>
</ul>


<p>Once you&rsquo;ve started to do this, you&rsquo;ll get in the habit and find that the time you save makes up for time spent adding to your FAQ.</p>

<p>What tricks do you use to save time at work?</p>

<p>PS- If you would like a tool that can help you build your own personal FAQs at work, you can try <a href="https://corpqna.com">CorpQNA</a>.  It will create and maintain your FAQ for you, let you share it, and do a lot of Q&amp;A stuff that you might expect if your team really gets into it.</p>

<p>When I am coding, I am in a comfortable environment (Visual Studio) and workstation is completely setup for writing</p>

<p>I have always struggled with a good environment for writing.  Currently, I switch between vim and Sublime Text, but I don&#8217;t really find either of those to be effective, since they are lacking tools to help me lookup things and integrate them into my workflow.</p>

    <updated>2013-07-14T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://douglastarr.com/rails-vs-csharp</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In which I write a few thoughts on Rails v CSharp</p>
<p>I originally published this on Seattle Tech Startups mailing list</p>
<ul>
<li>The market in Seattle is distorted with a lot more startup oriented .NET devs than you will see in just about any other city.</li>
<li>When I tell people that I work on .NET startups in SF, and they are Rails devs, they look at me like I&#8217;m crazy and building my app in COBOL.NET.  They still think ASP.NET == WebForms.</li>
<li>BizSpark is offering effectively 3 years of free hosting to startups.  This is changing the market and getting more new companies to try out .NET</li>
<li>The dynamic features of the CLR / .NET still are not as useful as the dynamic features of Rails.</li>
<li>ASP.NET MVC / WebAPI is on par with Rails</li>
<li>Entity Framework Code First is not as good as Active Record.</li>
<li>People&#8217;s faith in Rails security has been shaken this year by a series of apocolyptic security flaws.</li>
<li>.NET security is very good.</li>
<li>The user model in rails is more extensible and well thought out than the off-the-shelf ASP.NET model.</li>
<li>The rubygems ecoysystem is better than the nuget ecosystem, (and probably always will be)</li>
<li>is mitigated by a lot of javascript based services that function the same way as a gem might.</li>
<li>Azure no longer sucks.</li>
<li>If you believe in OSS as a core part of your being, you will always feel second rate in the .NET world, compared to the Ruby world.</li>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[An intercom.io playbook]]></title>
    <link href="http://douglastarr.com/my-intercom-playbook/"/>
    <updated>2013-07-04T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://douglastarr.com/my-intercom-playbook</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[	<p>At <a href="https://corpqna.com">CorpQNA</a>, we use <a href="http://intercom.io">intercom.io</a> to manage our web CRM.  It&#8217;s a fairly sophisticated product, and there are a few tricks that I&#8217;ve learned that I thought that I would share.</p>

	<h3>Send out your newsletters using tags</h3>
		<p>Avoid using the &#8220;manual&#8221; message to send newsletters.	Using tags lets you easily control large sends, and then also lets you repurpose your content for future users.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Create a new tag, and tag yourself with it, that says &#8220;Blue Newsletter&#8221;.</li>
			<li>Write your email, and target it at people only with the &#8220;Blue Newsletter&#8221; tag.</li>
			<li>Tag some small % of your users with the &#8220;Blue Newsletter&#8221; and watch open / click rates.</li>
			<li>Monitor open / click rates via intercom.</li>
			<li>Once you are happy with your results - resend it to the whole group.</li>
		</ul>	


	<h3>Use LastContacted to reduce email overload</h3>
		<p>It can be overwhelming to put together a DRIP campaign for your website.  Given intercom&#8217;s interface, it&#8217;s kind of hard to know who is going to receive what message, at what time.</p>

		<p>What this often leads to is users being blasted by multiple emails in too short of a time period.</p>

		<p>Intercom has a field called LastContacted.  In all of your Auto messages, just make sure LastContact > 3 days, so that you don&#8217;t contact your users more than every 3 days, regardless of whatever other rules you&#8217;ve setup.</p>

	<h3>Use a big call to action near the top of your newsletter</h3>

		<p>We&#8217;ve found that most users click the first big link they see.  Maybe this is because they don&#8217;t read the whole newsletter, maybe because they are trained that way, who knows.  In any case, it&#8217;s good to take advantage of that by putting a big call to action in a large font right near the top of your newsletter.  It will probably get the most clicks.</p>

	<h3>Tag your links with Google Analytics Campaigns</h3>
		<p>Assuming you use Google Analytics, you can tag each link separately with the utm_* keywords.  This lets you see how each link is doing.</p>

	<h3>Use Intercom as a lightweight email list for your leads</h3>
		<p>If you have users who are not using your product, but perhaps have signed up for your newsletter, make sure they are on your list by dropping your intercom javascript on the &#8220;Thank you&#8221; page.  Mark these users separate from logged in users.  Beware, though.   With the new intercom pricing, this can be prohibitive since you may have a lot more people signing up for your mailing list than actually using your product, and you are charged by the active user.</p>

	<h3>Copy the intercom playbook</h3>
		<p>If you don&#8217;t know what to do with your email campaign, start by copying the experts.  Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://insideintercom.io/does-your-app-have-a-message-schedule/">great article from intercom</a> on some ideas to include in your campaign.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Each time you have a new idea, put your notes in a repo for it, instead of simply storing it Dropbox or on your local computer.</p>

<p>If it&#8217;s an open source project, push that repo to Github.  Then you can advertise it on a public repository like Github, and actually start working on it and without having it complete.</p>

<p>This will get you started quicker, and when you have some time or you want to go back to that project, it will be all ready for you.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div>To set IP Restrictions in Windows Azure, you have to do 2 things, create an azure startup task in your service configuration (.cscg file), and a cmd file that runs it.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Create a Service Configuration Startup Task to run a startup command</strong></div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;Startup&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;Task commandLine=&#8221;startup\ip-restrictions.cmd&#8221; executionContext=&#8221;elevated&#8221;&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;Environment&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;Variable name=&#8221;EMULATED&#8221;&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;RoleInstanceValue xpath=&#8221;/RoleEnvironment/Deployment/@emulated&#8221; /&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/Variable&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;Variable name=&#8221;RESTRICTIP&#8221;&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;RoleInstanceValue xpath=&#8221;/RoleEnvironment/CurrentInstance/ConfigurationSettings/ConfigurationSetting[@name=&#8217;RestrictIp&#8217;]/@value&#8221;/&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/Variable&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/Environment&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/Task&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/Startup&gt;</div>
<p />
</div>
<div>
<div><strong>Create a startup command</strong>&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>This startup command checks the &#8220;RESTRICTIP&#8221; variable so that you can have different deployments that you can set whether or not to restrict IPs by (beta, test, production, etc). &nbsp;It also bypasses this if you are running the Azure Emulator.</div>
<p />
<div>This installs the IP Restriction Windows Role, unlocks the IIS Config, and sets the appropriate IP Restrictions (put your IP in place of 1.2.3.4)</div>
<p />
<p />
<div>
<div>if &#8220;%RESTRICTIP%&#8221;==&#8221;false&#8221; goto :EOF</div>
<div>if &#8220;%EMULATED%&#8221;==&#8221;true&#8221; goto :EOF</div>
<p />
<div>powershell Install-WindowsFeature Web-IP-Security</div>
<div>%windir%\system32\inetsrv\AppCmd.exe unlock config -section:system.webServer/security/ipSecurity</div>
<div>
<div>%windir%\system32\inetsrv\AppCmd.exe set config -section:system.webServer/security/ipSecurity /~ /commit:apphost</div>
</div>
<div>%windir%\system32\inetsrv\AppCmd.exe set config -section:system.webServer/security/ipSecurity /allowUnlisted:false /commit:apphost</div>
<div>%windir%\system32\inetsrv\AppCmd.exe set config -section:system.webServer/security/ipSecurity /+&#8221;[ipAddress=&#8217;1.2.3.4&#8217;,allowed=&#8217;True&#8217;]&#8221; /commit:apphost</div>
</div>
<p />
<p />
<div>This particular solution will not work well if you are trying to have IP restrictions on your staging deployment, and not your production deployment, since the startup command only runs on a deploy, and you will likely just swap VIPs to go from staging to production.</div>

    <id>http://douglastarr.com/don-t-prototype-on-your-own-platform</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When building a new feature for your website, avoid using the legacy platform that the rest of the site is built on. </p> <p>Legacy integrations take longer. Your goal with a prototype is to validate if it&#39;s worthwhile. This will take more work if your integration exposes bugs or side effects in legacy systems. </p> <p>New designs get coupled to legacy issues. For instance, you may have a complex registration funnel for your main product. But your new feature may not require that, and might be better off with a simple process. You may find that the simpler registration feeds the more complex multi stage process, rather than pushing full registration for a new feature. </p> <p>Deep integrations can mask issues with your prototype. You may see user adoption, but only because the new feature is very visible to your installed base. The prototype might be flawed and produce false positive results because of the legacy integration. </p> <p>Modern platforms with better features are ignored. You may have a poor search function on your site. Requiring the prototype to use the legacy search isn&#39;t really necessary. You can take advantage of newer versions of software by limiting their use to your prototype. </p> <p>You can break legacy inertia with prototypes. If your prototype requires newer versions of platform components, you will build more company expertise in the new version. This will make it more likely that you can migrate legacy code to new versions. </p> <p>Build new prototypes in isolation, so that you can develop faster, learn more and make better product decisions. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It has become prevalent to use &#8220;failing fast&#8221; as jargon for &#8220;learning&#8221;. &nbsp;It is not valuable to fail. Failure means &#8220;lack of success&#8221;. It doesn&#8217;t mean learning.</p>
<p>When something fails, it is common to identify the failure, and then state that you learned from the failure.</p>
<p>You learn nothing from failure.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have a theory on why you&#8217;ve failed, then make an effort to fix the failure. If you are successful, you will have learned something.</p>
<p>You learned from the success, not the failure. &nbsp;Failure is not sufficient, or even required, for success.</p>
<p>To succeed, prefer to study success. &nbsp;Avoid studying failure, it is a waste of time.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div>If you summarize your idea in your first sentence, writing &#8220;TLDR&#8221; is superfluous. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>The English Language already has tools to summarize and communicate your thoughts. &nbsp;Leverage existing conventions, which are accepted by a larger population, and you will engage more users and succeed in communicating your idea.</div>
<p />
<div>&#8220;TLDR&#8221; stands for &#8220;Too Long, didn&#8217;t read&#8221;, and began as a response to the &#8220;wall of text&#8221; style of writing that would appear on sites like Reddit. &nbsp; Over time, it became a shorthand way of saying &#8220;Here&#8217;s a summary.&#8221;. &nbsp;<p /> However, if you actually wrote the article, it is asinine to preface it with &#8220;Too Long; Didn&#8217;t Read&#8221;. &nbsp; &nbsp;Of course you read it. &nbsp;You wrote it.<p />Instead, edit your article, and make sure to summarize your point in the first sentence.</div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are using IISExpress for your web server during development, and you try to route static files to dynamic files, IISExpress will not respect rerouting those files.</p>
<p />
<div>Ie, if you have a dynamic robots.txt file like this:</div>
<p />
<div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; routes.MapRoute(&#8220;Robots.txt&#8221;,</div>

</div>
<p />
<div>You will get a standard 404 error which tries to map it to a static handler.</div>
<p />
<div>To fix, you need to configure web.config like so:</div>
<div>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>&lt;system.webServer&gt;
